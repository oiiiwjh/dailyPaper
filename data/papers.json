    "abstract": "AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for\nenvironments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and\nreasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite\nhuman play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued:\nmost hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple\nrounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to\nachieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized\nby extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a\nmodel-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played\nat an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and\nequity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also\noutperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning\nabilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,\nrandomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class\nhuman players.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative dialogue relies on participants incrementally establishing\ncommon ground, yet in asymmetric settings they may believe they agree while\nreferring to different entities. We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme\nfor the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures\nspeaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression,\nenabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over\ntime. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k\nannotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the\nresulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings\nare rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies\nsystematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask\nreferential misalignment.

    "abstract": "Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the\nphysical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,\nresulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of\nAI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to\nautomate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical\nbottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of\nexplainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of\nthe tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for\nsample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs\na multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based\nagents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design\ngoals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the\ntarget goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation\nstrategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.\nThe AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity\nand is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from\npure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system\nlearns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate\nconvergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog\ndesign space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents\nserve as transparent design assistants.",

In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent\nSDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these\ndesiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent\ncomponents of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents,\nwhich has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple\ninterface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the\ndefault case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents\nwith features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security\nand reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability,\nintegrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can\nconnect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS\nCode, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing\nSDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native\nsandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and\nbuilt-in security analysis. Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA\nbenchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Put together, these elements allow\nthe OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for\nprototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably\ndeploying agents at scale.",

This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack\nthat infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet\nsize and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption\nprotecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to\nenable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs\nfrom major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC)\nand high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target\nratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive\ntopics like \"money laundering\" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations.\nThis industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under\nnetwork surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate\nthree mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet\ninjection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides\ncomplete protection.

    ],
    "abstract": "To foster trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union,\nthe AI Act requires providers to mark and detect the outputs of their\ngeneral-purpose models. The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods\nthat are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet,\nthe rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards\ncan be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses\nthis challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the\nmultiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct\nconcepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking\nCategorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods\naccording to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,\nduring, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2)\nWatermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping\neach criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and\ndetectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since\ninteroperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we\npropose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking\nComparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the\noperationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all\nfour standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further\nresearch into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture\nof LLMs.",

To address this, we introduce\nLiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in\nrealistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles:\n(i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on\noffline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing\nreal-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends\ncontrol from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk\nmanagement and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across\nstructurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction\nmarkets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each\nstep, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs\npercentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we\nrun 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1)\nhigh LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display\ndistinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and\n(3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These\nfindings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence,\nmotivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency\nunder live uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks can approximate solutions to partial differential equations,\nbut they often break the very laws they are meant to model-creating mass from\nnowhere, drifting shocks, or violating conservation and entropy. We address\nthis by training within the laws of physics rather than beside them. Our\nframework, called Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL), keeps every update\nphysically admissible by projecting network outputs onto the intersection of\nconstraint sets defined by conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and\npositivity. The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10%\ncomputational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We\nfurther stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small\noscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long\nprediction horizons. Together, these mechanisms eliminate both hard and soft\nviolations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth\nvanishes, and entropy and error remain bounded. On Burgers and Euler systems,\nCPL produces stable, physically lawful solutions without loss of accuracy.\nInstead of hoping neural solvers will respect physics, CPL makes that behavior\nan intrinsic property of the learning process.",

To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences\nQuantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user\npersonalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation\nFrameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference\nconflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically\nassumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates\nboth users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment,\nallowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts.\nPreferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose\nstrength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's\nproperties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic\ncase study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting\npreferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment\ntask. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base\nscores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and\ncontextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and\ncontext-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work\nadvances the field of multi-user HRI.

However, the literature at the intersection of\nthese verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper\nintroduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for\nanalyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through\nLLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain\nknowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting\nnatively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time\nseries data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2\nCLI tools (\"ros2 bag list\" or \"ros2 bag info\"), as well as the ability to\nfilter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP\nserver, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling\nwith different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source\n(through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling\ncapabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both\nproprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that\nthere is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude\nSonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance.

    "abstract": "The human hand plays a vital role in daily life and industrial applications,\nyet replicating its multifunctional capabilities-including motion, sensing, and\ncoordinated manipulation-with robotic systems remains a formidable challenge.\nDeveloping a dexterous robotic hand requires balancing human-like agility with\nengineering constraints such as complexity, size-to-weight ratio, durability,\nand force-sensing performance. This letter presents Dex-Hand 021, a\nhigh-performance, cable-driven five-finger robotic hand with 12 active and 7\npassive degrees of freedom (DoFs), achieving 19 DoFs dexterity in a lightweight\n1 kg design. We propose a proprioceptive force-sensing-based admittance control\nmethod to enhance manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate its superior\nperformance: a single-finger load capacity exceeding 10 N, fingertip\nrepeatability under 0.001 m, and force estimation errors below 0.2 N. Compared\nto PID control, joint torques in multi-object grasping are reduced by 31.19%,\nsignificantly improves force-sensing capability while preventing overload\nduring collisions. The hand excels in both power and precision grasps,\nsuccessfully executing 33 GRASP taxonomy motions and complex manipulation\ntasks. This work advances the design of lightweight, industrial-grade dexterous\nhands and enhances proprioceptive control, contributing to robotic manipulation\nand intelligent manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "As the \"agentic web\" takes shape-billions of AI agents (often LLM-powered)\nautonomously transacting and collaborating-trust shifts from human oversight to\nprotocol design. In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this\nshift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2),\nand Ethereum's ERC-8004 \"Trustless Agents,\" yet their underlying trust\nassumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of\ntrust models in inter-agent protocol design: Brief (self- or third-party\nverifiable claims), Claim (self-proclaimed capabilities and identity, e.g.\nAgentCard), Proof (cryptographic verification, including zero-knowledge proofs\nand trusted execution environment attestations), Stake (bonded collateral with\nslashing and insurance), Reputation (crowd feedback and graph-based trust\nsignals), and Constraint (sandboxing and capability bounding). For each, we\nanalyze assumptions, attack surfaces, and design trade-offs, with particular\nemphasis on LLM-specific fragilities-prompt injection,\nsycophancy/nudge-susceptibility, hallucination, deception, and\nmisalignment-that render purely reputational or claim-only approaches brittle.\nOur findings indicate no single mechanism suffices. We argue for\ntrustless-by-default architectures anchored in Proof and Stake to gate\nhigh-impact actions, augmented by Brief for identity and discovery and\nReputation overlays for flexibility and social signals. We comparatively\nevaluate A2A, AP2, ERC-8004 and related historical variations in academic\nresearch under metrics spanning security, privacy, latency/cost, and social\nrobustness (Sybil/collusion/whitewashing resistance). We conclude with hybrid\ntrust model recommendations that mitigate reputation gaming and misinformed LLM\nbehavior, and we distill actionable design guidelines for safer, interoperable,\nand scalable agent economies.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to\nsignificant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and\nCoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,\nknown as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these\nmodels often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While\ntraditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data\naugmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based\nmodifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely\nunexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,\nparticularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support\nand enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between\nthese augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to\nimprove generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such\nas CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that\nfocus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose\nAdding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces\nadversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations\nintroduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This\ndecoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually\ndiscriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently\noutperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and\ndomain generalization settings.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of open-access (OA) publications has intensified the\nchallenge of identifying relevant scientific papers. Due to privacy constraints\nand limited access to user interaction data, recent efforts have shifted toward\ncontent-based recommendation, which relies solely on textual information.\nHowever, existing models typically treat papers as unstructured text,\nneglecting their discourse organization and thereby limiting semantic\ncompleteness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose\nOMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective,\nMethod, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning,\nand structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style\nsummarization module converts raw papers into structured and\ndiscourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives\nalign semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels.\nThe final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through\ncontextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly\nconstructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in\nPrecision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that\nQA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete\nrepresentations.

We\nassessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and\nROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the\nthinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for\nthe majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as\nopen-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal,\nhighlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced\nmethods for medical knowledge integration.",

Fairness notions commonly rely on protected\nattributes to assess potential biases. Here, the majority of literature focuses\non discrete setups regarding both target and protected attributes. The\nliterature on continuous attributes especially in conjunction with regression\n-- we refer to this as \\emph{continuous fairness} -- is scarce. A common\nstrategy is iterative null-space projection which as of now has only been\nexplored for linear models or embeddings such as obtained by a non-linear\nencoder.

    "abstract": "Automatic evaluation of speech-to-text translation (ST) systems is typically\nperformed by comparing translation hypotheses with one or more reference\ntranslations. While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the\nlimitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from\nthe source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that\nneural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with\nhuman judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the\nsource is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments\nbetween source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct\nthe first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular\nfocus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not\navailable. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual\nproxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and\nback-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch\nbetween synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried\nout on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with\ndiverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts\nconstitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word\nerror rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a\ncomputationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT\nmetrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled\nevaluation methodologies for speech translation.",

We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments\nunder various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be\ninterconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from\nminimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality\nScale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine\nother psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing\nhuman psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from\nLLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >\n0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on\nsemantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms\ntrained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that\nLLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five\nresponses into natural language personality summaries through information\nselection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.\nSecond, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these\nsummaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality\nfactors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item\nimportance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely\nredundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to\noriginal scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,\nsecond-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs\ncan precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from\nminimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a\npowerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their\nemergent reasoning capabilities.",

This\nleaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more\ngeneral and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively\ninvestigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details\nand process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings\nreveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues\nand seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,\nwe propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions\n(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems\nwith an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various\nopen-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image\nbenchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive\nperformance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging\nscenarios where existing prompting methods fail.",

    "abstract": "In an effort to counter the increasing IoT botnet-based attacks,\nstate-of-the-art deep learning methods have been proposed and have achieved\nimpressive detection accuracy. However, their computational intensity restricts\ndeployment on resource-constrained IoT devices, creating a critical need for\nlightweight detection models. A common solution to this challenge is model\ncompression via quantization. This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework\nwhere an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors\nderived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a\npretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization\nstrategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization\n(PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection\nperformance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT\nbotnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with\nrespect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable\ndecline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original\nunquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in\nsize, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the\npracticality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.",

    "abstract": "The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains,\nleading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional\nmethods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this,\nwe formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework\nthat integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces\nspecialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine\ndesign candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the\naerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of\nthree key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems\nEngineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to\nconstruct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.\nThe Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical\nrequirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer\nleverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose\ncandidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and\nprovides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge\ngraph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the\nmanager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics\nsuch as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how\ncollaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can\nenhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.",

This limits autonomy and environmental\nawareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer\nstrategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel\nefficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic\nmissions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is\nhighlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition\nand digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables\nadaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and\ndecision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced\nPositioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation\ncapabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for\nmapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems\nsupport autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated\nsatellite swarm operations.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially influenced various software\nengineering tasks. Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional\nLLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code\nquality. However, these LLMs often rely on static, detailed instructions for\nspecific tasks. In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving\ncontexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and\nexecuting workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based\nagents in supporting refactoring activities. Specifically, we introduce\nRefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software\nrefactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning,\nexecuting, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection\nand tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java\nprojects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a\nsearch-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our\nassessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software\nquality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the\ncontribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that\nRefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a\nmedian of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a\nmedian of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and\nthe search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a\nmedian F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent\napproaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the\nmedian compilation success rate by 40.1%. These findings highlight the promise\nof multi-agent architectures in advancing automated software refactoring.",

In contrast,\npretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated\nstrong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities.

Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module\nthat retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on\nthem. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference\ntime, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates.\nBy combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap\nbetween robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction.\nExtensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones\nshow that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a\nscalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements\nin optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant\nimportance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily\nmanifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and\nother unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order\nmethods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient\ninformation, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are\nill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the\nrapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial\nimprovements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.\nConsequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language\nmodels has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we\nchoose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel\napproach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large\nlanguage model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical\nPart(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further\nutilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the\nmulti-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific\ntasks: the \\textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \\textit{electronic\ndesign automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs\ngenerated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on\nmany problem instances.",

In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect\nimagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,\nteams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,\nrepresenting more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by\nsubject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.\nTo alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and\nmachine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed\nto automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state\nof practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has\nbeen confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice\nvia the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment\nwith sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known\ndataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage\nlabels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners.

The state variable satisfies a\ndiscrete diffusion law on a weighted, oriented graph, where conductances are\nscaled by edge lengths to preserve geometric fidelity. Boundary potentials act\nas controls that drive interior fluxes according to a linear network Laplacian.\nThe optimization problem enforces physically meaningful sign and flux-cap\nconstraints at all boundary edges, derived directly from a gradient bound. This\nyields a finite-dimensional LP whose feasible set is polyhedral, and whose\nboundedness and solvability follow from simple geometric or algebraic\nconditions on the network data.\n  We prove that under the absence of negative recession\ndirections--automatically satisfied in the presence of finite box bounds, flux\ncaps, or sign restrictions--the LP admits a global minimizer. Several\nsufficient conditions guaranteeing boundedness of the feasible region are\nidentified, covering both full-rank and rank-deficient flux maps. The analysis\nconnects classical results such as the Minkowski--Weyl decomposition, Hoffman's\nbound, and the fundamental theorem of linear programming with modern\nnetwork-based diffusion modeling.\n  Two large-scale examples illustrate the framework: (i) A typical large\nstadium in a major modern city, which forms a single connected component with\nrelatively uniform corridor widths, and a (ii) A complex street network\nemanating from a large, historical city center, which forms a multi-component\nsystem.",

While\nrecent advances in generative models offer a promising way for inverse design,\nmost approaches require large datasets and must be retrained for every new\ntarget property. Here, we introduce the EGMOF (Efficient Generation of MOFs), a\nhybrid diffusion-transformer framework that overcomes these limitations through\na modular, descriptor-mediated workflow. EGMOF decomposes inverse design into\ntwo steps: (1) a one-dimensional diffusion model (Prop2Desc) that maps desired\nproperties to chemically meaningful descriptors followed by (2) a transformer\nmodel (Desc2MOF) that generates structures from these descriptors. This modular\nhybrid design enables minimal retraining and maintains high accuracy even under\nsmall-data conditions. On a hydrogen uptake dataset, EGMOF achieved over 95%\nvalidity and 84% hit rate, representing significant improvements of up to 57%\nin validity and 14% in hit rate compared to existing methods, while remaining\neffective with only 1,000 training samples. Moreover, our model successfully\nperformed conditional generation across 29 diverse property datasets, including\nCoREMOF, QMOF, and text-mined experimental datasets, whereas previous models\nhave not.

To handle saliency variations across defects,\nwe introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages\nfocused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information\nGuided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided\nattention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student\nmodel. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background\ninterference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects.

We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to\nenforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative\ntrajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed\nmanifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising\nscores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow.

In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean\nSquare Deviation of 0.99 {\\AA} when superposing on the variable region, a 25%\nimprovement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest\nreported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%.

We therefore propose a new organizing\nprinciple guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in\nhow these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based\nmonitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are\ngeneralist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across\nnumerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task\nindependently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model\ncapabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety\nguardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses,\nlong-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss.\nWe describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and\nprofessional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach.\nUltimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for\nsafe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist\nartificial intelligence models in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and\nenvironment configurations in search of improved system performance. With\napplication domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management,\nco-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems.\nHowever, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under\nhigh-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency\nwhen addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these\nchallenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and\nsample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically\nrelevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we\nintroduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables\nDiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while\nsatisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.\nSecond, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the\nreinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts\nto evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.\nTogether, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when\nvalidated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including\nwarehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our\nmethod consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39%\nhigher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This\nsets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone\ntowards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.",

    "abstract": "Modern artificial intelligence has revolutionized our ability to extract rich\nand versatile data representations across scientific disciplines. Yet, the\nstatistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled,\ncausing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare\nsignals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,\ncreating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine\nthis gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods\noperating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;\nlocality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote\nefficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of\nself-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation\nspace around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these\nprinciples, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained\nwithin a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the\nlikelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,\nanomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms\nthat drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional\nproblems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion\ndetection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the\nnatural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing\nonly a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous\nlocations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring\nboth the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.",

Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV\ndemonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet,\nthese techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using\nframeworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static\ngraphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it\ndifficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention\nalgorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such\ntechniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well\nunderstood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this\npaper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and\nDeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be\ndeployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way\ntensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators\nrunning at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real\nproduction setting.

Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101\n-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with\ncompetitive performance.

Moreover, they directly detect social groups\nwithout explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.\nThese drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and\nintroduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social\ninteractions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware\nbottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction\ndetection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions\nusing body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first\ndetects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then\ninfers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based\nreasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social\ncues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.\nExperiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior\nmethods, achieving the new state of the art.",

In this work, we propose an automated method for\nstandardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the\nembryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.\nThe candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three\nstrategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image\nmatching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest\nclassifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D\nultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional\nCohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,\nPCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate\nwas selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%,\n95.8%, and 98.4% of images, respectively. A Majority Vote of these selection\nmethods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to\nsignificant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and\nCoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,\nknown as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these\nmodels often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While\ntraditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data\naugmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based\nmodifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely\nunexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,\nparticularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support\nand enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between\nthese augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to\nimprove generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such\nas CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that\nfocus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose\nAdding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces\nadversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations\nintroduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This\ndecoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually\ndiscriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently\noutperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and\ndomain generalization settings.

Using $\\sim45,000$ image patches\nsourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and public datasets, a fusion model\ncombining a ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and a Vision\nTransformer (ViT) was developed. This model successfully captured both local\nmorphological texture and global tissue context. The pipeline achieved a robust\noverall subtype classification accuracy of $84.2\\%$ (Macro AUC of $0.87 \\pm\n0.03$). Crucially, the model demonstrated the capacity for gene mutation\ninference with moderate-to-high accuracy: $AUC_{TP53} = 0.82 \\pm 0.02$,\n$AUC_{BRCA1} = 0.76 \\pm 0.04$, and $AUC_{ARID1A} = 0.73 \\pm 0.05$.

Furthermore,\nthis cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module,\nwhich dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To\nenhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce\nModality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly\namplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint\nsynthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks\nwithin a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation,\nvideo-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive\nexperiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M),\nUniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre\nconsistency, and emotion consistency.",

    "abstract": "Entropy Minimization (EM) is beneficial to reducing class overlap, bridging\ndomain gap, and restricting uncertainty for various tasks in machine learning,\nyet its potential is limited. To study the internal mechanism of EM, we\nreformulate and decouple the classical EM into two parts with opposite effects:\ncluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) rewards dominant classes and prompts\na peaked output distribution, while gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC)\npenalizes high-confidence classes based on predicted probabilities.\nFurthermore, we reveal the limitations of classical EM caused by its coupled\nformulation: 1) reward collapse impedes the contribution of high-certainty\nsamples in the learning process, and 2) easy-class bias induces misalignment\nbetween output distribution and label distribution. To address these issues, we\npropose Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM), which normalizes the\nreward brought from CADF and employs a marginal entropy calibrator (MEC) to\nreplace GMC. AdaDEM outperforms DEM*, an upper-bound variant of classical EM,\nand achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised\nlearning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.",

Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when\ncooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a\nstraightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key\nchallenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level\nfundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level\ndiscriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we\npropose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively\ndecouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative\nability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a\nlightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional\ndecomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order\nstatistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance\ntheir discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor\narchitecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss\nweights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial\ntraining phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of\ndiscriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of\nearly stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability\ntowards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively\ndecouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms\nof architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various\ndatasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms\nits counterparts when reducing computational cost.",

Despite growing emphasis on\ndata-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which\naccumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage. This\nresults in inefficient storage, costly labeling, and limited generalization. To\naddress this, this paper introduces \\ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data\ncollection as a closed-loop control problem. \\ac{FCDC} continuously\napproximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online\nprobabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on\nfeedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this\nfeedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and\nexploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from\naccumulating over time. Besides showcasing the controllability of \\ac{FCDC} on\na synthetic dataset, experiments on a real data stream show that \\ac{FCDC}\nproduces more balanced datasets by $\\SI{25.9}{\\percent}$ while reducing data\nstorage by $\\SI{39.8}{\\percent}$.

    "abstract": "Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or\ngenerative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield\nsoft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,\nwhen trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask\nconditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,\ndiffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real\nimage, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is\nused as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which\nmixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard\nmask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly\nbridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging\ndiversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned\nwith real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the\nmixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually\nre-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.\nAcross Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC\n2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and\nconsistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining\nlabel-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive\nre-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.",

Our findings\nreveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues\nand seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning.

Existing surgical VQA\ndatasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future.

It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and\n734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert\nannotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming\ninstrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video\nlanguage model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal\nCross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,\nwhile an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the\ntoken level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone\nto the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and\nEndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines.

We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB\nfeatures and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.\nTo efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient\nprojection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a\nSubsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient\nfine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing\nrepresentational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB\nand depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new\nLaparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.\nOn the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice\nSimilarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface\nDistance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,\nwe evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive\nperformance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating\nstrong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical\nenvironments. These results demonstrate that our SRFT-GaLore-enhanced\ndual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under\nreal-time, depth-constrained surgical settings.",

In this work, we revisit an orthogonal\ndirection: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict\nLoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based\napproaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to\nmimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with\nan end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization,\nyielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for\nper-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity\nand prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at\ninference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG),\nwhich combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the\nsubject fidelity of personalized models during sampling.

However, conventional\napproaches typically rely on prior knowledge of the target domain or require\nmodel retraining, limiting their practicality in dynamic or\nresource-constrained environments. Recent test-time adaptation methods based on\nbatch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but\nthey often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained\nto specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration\n(AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation\ndistributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the\nfull shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures\nemploying BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of\nestimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a\nrobust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our\nmethod leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling\nunsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C,\nCIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR\nachieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing\ntest-time adaptation baselines.

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view\nsynthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely\ncaptured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting\ntheir practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three\nsparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,\nrendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity\nof input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of\ncamera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D\nreconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a\nprior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,\nfollowed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training\nefficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely\nsparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric\nconstraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering\nfidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950\nclinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to\nsimulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and\nachieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion\nvisualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of natural language processing (NLP) technologies,\nthe demand for high-quality Chinese document question-answering datasets is\nsteadily growing. To address this issue, we present the Chinese Multi-Document\nQuestion Answering Dataset(ChiMDQA), specifically designed for downstream\nbusiness scenarios across prevalent domains including academic, education,\nfinance, law, medical treatment, and news. ChiMDQA encompasses long-form\ndocuments from six distinct fields, consisting of 6,068 rigorously curated,\nhigh-quality question-answer (QA) pairs further classified into ten\nfine-grained categories. Through meticulous document screening and a systematic\nquestion-design methodology, the dataset guarantees both diversity and high\nquality, rendering it applicable to various NLP tasks such as document\ncomprehension, knowledge extraction, and intelligent QA systems. Additionally,\nthis paper offers a comprehensive overview of the dataset's design objectives,\nconstruction methodologies, and fine-grained evaluation system, supplying a\nsubstantial foundation for future research and practical applications in\nChinese QA.

    ],
    "abstract": "To foster trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union,\nthe AI Act requires providers to mark and detect the outputs of their\ngeneral-purpose models. The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods\nthat are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet,\nthe rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards\ncan be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses\nthis challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the\nmultiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct\nconcepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking\nCategorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods\naccording to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,\nduring, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2)\nWatermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping\neach criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and\ndetectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since\ninteroperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we\npropose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking\nComparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the\noperationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all\nfour standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further\nresearch into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture\nof LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward\nunseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across\nbenchmarks--from knowledge quizzes and math reasoning to web-agent tasks--but\nthese tests occur in static settings, lacking real dynamics and uncertainty.\nConsequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than\ndecision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce\nLiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in\nrealistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles:\n(i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on\noffline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing\nreal-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends\ncontrol from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk\nmanagement and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across\nstructurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction\nmarkets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each\nstep, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs\npercentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we\nrun 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1)\nhigh LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display\ndistinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and\n(3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These\nfindings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence,\nmotivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency\nunder live uncertainty.",

We\nconducted experiments on the WikiText corpus using a two-layer transformer\narchitecture, systematically varying the locality parameter {\\lambda} across\nthe full spectrum from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed).

Studies have shown that\nwhen human children learn language, they consistently favor hypotheses based on\nhierarchical syntactic rules without ever encountering disambiguating examples.\nA recent line of work has inquired as to whether common neural network\narchitectures share this bias, finding that they do so only under special\nconditions: when syntactically supervised, when pre-trained on massive corpora,\nor when trained long past convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the\nfirst time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in\nhuman-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements:\nstack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer,\nsimple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack\nof Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed\nby DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic\nstacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question\nformation task. We also propose a modification to the stack RNN architecture\nthat improves hierarchical generalization.

    "abstract": "Memory systems are key components that enable AI systems such as LLMs and AI\nagents to achieve long-term learning and sustained interaction. However, during\nmemory storage and retrieval, these systems frequently exhibit memory\nhallucinations, including fabrication, errors, conflicts, and omissions.\nExisting evaluations of memory hallucinations are primarily end-to-end question\nanswering, which makes it difficult to localize the operational stage within\nthe memory system where hallucinations arise. To address this, we introduce the\nHallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level\nhallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines\nthree evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question\nanswering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different\noperational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct\nuser-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and\nHaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type\nquestions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns,\nwith context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations\nacross different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based\non HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate\nhallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently\npropagate errors to the question answering stage. Future research should focus\non developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that\nsystematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.",

This study\nuses a novel text-based approach to measure the idea-level diffusion of social\nscience knowledge from the research domain to the journalism and policy-making\ndomains. By doing so, we expand the detection of knowledge diffusion beyond the\nmeasurements of direct references. Our study focuses on media effects theories\nas key research ideas in the field of communication science. Using 72,703\ndocuments (2000-2019) from three domains (i.e., research, journalism, and\npolicy-making) that mention these ideas, we count the mentions of these ideas\nin each domain, estimate their domain-specific contexts, and track and compare\ndifferences across domains and over time. Overall, we find that diffusion\npatterns and dynamics vary considerably between ideas, with some ideas\ndiffusing between other domains, while others do not. Based on the embedding\nregression approach, we compare contextualized meanings across domains and find\nthat the distances between research and policy are typically larger than\nbetween research and journalism. We also find that ideas largely shift roles\nacross domains - from being the theories themselves in research to sense-making\nin news to applied, administrative use in policy. Over time, we observe\nsemantic convergence mainly for ideas that are practically oriented.

Such methods often overlook\ndeeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive\nfairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work,\nwe introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences\nencoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by\nsafety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases\noften relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which\npresent limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with\nadditional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to\nuncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals\nduring QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects,\npresenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future\ndevelopment of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment\ntraining.

    "abstract": "A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is\nthe emergence of \"reasoning MLLMs\" that offer explicit control over their\ninternal thinking processes (normally referred as the \"thinking mode\")\nalongside the standard \"non-thinking mode\". This capability allows these models\nto engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating\na final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these\n\"dual-state\" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning\nprocesses of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical\ntasks. This paper evaluates the active \"thinking mode\" capabilities of two\nleading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We\nassessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and\nROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the\nthinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for\nthe majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as\nopen-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal,\nhighlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced\nmethods for medical knowledge integration.",

    "abstract": "Automatic evaluation of speech-to-text translation (ST) systems is typically\nperformed by comparing translation hypotheses with one or more reference\ntranslations. While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the\nlimitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from\nthe source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that\nneural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with\nhuman judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the\nsource is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments\nbetween source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct\nthe first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular\nfocus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not\navailable. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual\nproxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and\nback-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch\nbetween synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried\nout on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with\ndiverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts\nconstitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word\nerror rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a\ncomputationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT\nmetrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled\nevaluation methodologies for speech translation.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across various\napplications, yet their potential security and ethical risks have raised\nincreasing concerns. Existing research employs red teaming evaluations,\nutilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs.\nHowever, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue\ntrajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the\nconsiderable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these\nlimitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on\ndynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process\nas a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an\nenhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a\ncollaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees. This\nalgorithm significantly improves the efficiency of optimal attack path search\nwhile substantially reducing the average number of queries required. Empirical\nevaluations on three open-source and two proprietary language models\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates\nabove 90\\% across the board, with a peak of 98\\% on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and\noutperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it achieves comparable success\nwith only 26 queries on average, significantly reducing red teaming overhead\nand highlighting its superior efficiency.",

    "abstract": "We revisit continual pre-training for large language models and argue that\nprogress now depends more on scaling the right structure than on scaling\nparameters alone. We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that\ninserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all\npre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies\nand increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original\nfunctionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation,\nwhich maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented\ninitialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative\nAdaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to\nacquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as\nSCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and\nSCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing\nbetween preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography\nbenchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion\nwhile still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean\ncorpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and\ncompetitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best\noverall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when\npreservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and\nadaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning\nsetups.",

We demonstrate\nour method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous\nvehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive\nvisualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder\nperspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show\nthat stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and\nconflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these\nstakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more\ntransparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance\ngoals.",

    "abstract": "As reasoning models scale rapidly, the essential role of multimodality in\nhuman cognition has come into sharp relief, driving a growing need to probe\nvision-centric cognitive behaviors. Yet, existing multimodal benchmarks either\noveremphasize textual reasoning or fall short of systematically capturing\nvision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving the cognitive capacity of MLLMs\ninsufficiently assessed. To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC\n(Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded\nbenchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three\nfundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and\nknowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs'\ncognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct\nextensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that\nclosed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs.\n30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak\n(less than or equal to 30%). We further identify common error patterns,\nincluding orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and\npoor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that\nChain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason ->\nverify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction. We hope this work catalyzes a\nshift toward treating the cognitive capacity of MLLMs as central to both\nevaluation and model design.",

To stabilize training, these methods\ntypically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each\nprompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),\nreducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.\n  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages\nfor each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we\npropose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt\nmeans to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --\nparticularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we\nconstruct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance\npolicy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a\ndrop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no\nadditional hyper-parameters or computation.

While deep learning offers a path to\nautomation, centralized training models conflict with data governance\nregulations and neglect the diagnostic importance of multi-scale analysis. In\nthis work, we propose a scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning (FL)\nframework for CRC histopathological grading that integrates multi-scale feature\nlearning within a distributed training paradigm. Our approach employs a\ndual-stream ResNetRS50 backbone to concurrently capture fine-grained nuclear\ndetail and broader tissue-level context. This architecture is integrated into a\nrobust FL system stabilized using FedProx to mitigate client drift across\nheterogeneous data distributions from multiple hospitals. Extensive evaluation\non the CRC-HGD dataset demonstrates that our framework achieves an overall\naccuracy of 83.5%, outperforming a comparable centralized model (81.6%).\nCrucially, the system excels in identifying the most aggressive Grade III\ntumors with a high recall of 87.5%, a key clinical priority to prevent\ndangerous false negatives. Performance further improves with higher\nmagnification, reaching 88.0% accuracy at 40x. These results validate that our\nfederated multi-scale approach not only preserves patient privacy but also\nenhances model performance and generalization.

    "abstract": "Post-hoc recalibration methods are widely used to ensure that classifiers\nprovide faithful probability estimates. We argue that parametric recalibration\nfunctions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple\ntheoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight\nmotivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard\ntemperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies\nin the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often\ncoupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff\ncan be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing\nand efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains\nover existing logistic-based calibration techniques. We provide efficient and\neasy-to-use open-source implementations of our methods, making them an\nattractive alternative to common temperature, vector, and matrix scaling\nimplementations.",

Eight machine learning\nmodels are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning\n(XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised\nlearning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph\nNeural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The\ncomprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score,\nprecision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost\nachieved 99\\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly\ndetection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively.\nLSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For\nattack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score\nwith the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy.\nGAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC.\nThese findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective\nanomaly detection strategies.

Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design.",

Traditional\nbeamforming techniques such as zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE) beamforming experience performance deterioration under\nadverse channel conditions. Deep learning-based beamforming offers an\nalternative with nonlinear mappings from channel state information (CSI) to\nbeamforming weights by improving robustness against dynamic channel\nenvironments. Transformer-based models are particularly effective due to their\nability to model long-range dependencies across time and frequency. However,\ntheir quadratic attention complexity limits scalability in large OFDM grids.\nRecent studies address this issue through sparse attention mechanisms that\nreduce complexity while maintaining expressiveness, yet often employ patterns\nthat disregard channel dynamics, as they are not specifically designed for\nwireless communication scenarios. In this work, we propose a Doppler-aware\nSparse Neural Network Beamforming (Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF) model that\nincorporates a channel-adaptive sparse attention mechanism in a multi-user\nsingle-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) setting. The proposed sparsity structure\nis configurable along 2D time-frequency axes based on channel dynamics and is\ntheoretically proven to ensure full connectivity within p hops, where p is the\nnumber of attention heads. Simulation results under urban macro (UMa) channel\nconditions show that Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF significantly outperforms both a\nfixed-pattern baseline, referred to as Standard Sparse NNBF, and conventional\nbeamforming techniques ZFBF and MMSE beamforming in high mobility scenarios,\nwhile maintaining structured sparsity with a controlled number of attended keys\nper query.",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action\ndemonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements\nseverely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide\nonly state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is\noften suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation\nreinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining\ndeep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from\nobservation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation\nQ-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs\nexpert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence\nmechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.\nThis enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training\nwhile maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further\nextend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to\ntackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a\nchallenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.\nHA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging\nprocedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to\nexpert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns\ncompared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit\nimitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous\naction settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging\nexpert datasets unusable by conventional approaches.

    "abstract": "High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex\ncalculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning\nalgorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the\nnumber of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While\nneural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent\ntensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more\nparameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods,\nwe propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor\ndecomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action\nspaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key\ninnovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with\nvisit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high\nuncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate\na frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage\nexploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to\nfrequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks\ndemonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL\napproaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for\nresource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling\ncosts are high.",

We address\nthis by training within the laws of physics rather than beside them. Our\nframework, called Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL), keeps every update\nphysically admissible by projecting network outputs onto the intersection of\nconstraint sets defined by conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and\npositivity. The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10%\ncomputational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We\nfurther stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small\noscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long\nprediction horizons. Together, these mechanisms eliminate both hard and soft\nviolations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth\nvanishes, and entropy and error remain bounded. On Burgers and Euler systems,\nCPL produces stable, physically lawful solutions without loss of accuracy.\nInstead of hoping neural solvers will respect physics, CPL makes that behavior\nan intrinsic property of the learning process.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the generalization behavior of learning algorithms is a central\ngoal of learning theory. A recently emerging explanation is that learning\nalgorithms are successful in practice because they converge to flat minima,\nwhich have been consistently associated with improved generalization\nperformance. In this work, we study the link between flat minima and\ngeneralization in the canonical setting of stochastic convex optimization with\na non-negative, $\\beta$-smooth objective. Our first finding is that, even in\nthis fundamental and well-studied setting, flat empirical minima may incur\ntrivial $\\Omega(1)$ population risk while sharp minima generalizes optimally.\nThen, we show that this poor generalization behavior extends to two natural\n''sharpness-aware'' algorithms originally proposed by Foret et al. (2021),\ndesigned to bias optimization toward flat solutions: Sharpness-Aware Gradient\nDescent (SA-GD) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). For SA-GD, which\nperforms gradient steps on the maximal loss in a predefined neighborhood, we\nprove that while it successfully converges to a flat minimum at a fast rate,\nthe population risk of the solution can still be as large as $\\Omega(1)$,\nindicating that even flat minima found algorithmically using a sharpness-aware\ngradient method might generalize poorly. For SAM, a computationally efficient\napproximation of SA-GD based on normalized ascent steps, we show that although\nit minimizes the empirical loss, it may converge to a sharp minimum and also\nincur population risk $\\Omega(1)$.

    "abstract": "This study addresses the system identification of a small autonomous surface\nvehicle (ASV) under moored conditions using Hankel dynamic mode decomposition\nwith control (HDMDc) and its Bayesian extension (BHDMDc). Experiments were\ncarried out on a Codevintec CK-14e ASV in the towing tank of CNR-INM, under\nboth irregular and regular head-sea wave conditions. The ASV under\ninvestigation features a recessed moon pool, which induces nonlinear responses\ndue to sloshing, thereby increasing the modelling challenge. Data-driven\nreduced-order models were built from measurements of vessel motions and mooring\nloads. The HDMDc framework provided accurate deterministic predictions of\nvessel dynamics, while the Bayesian formulation enabled uncertainty-aware\ncharacterization of the model response by accounting for variability in\nhyperparameter selection. Validation against experimental data demonstrated\nthat both HDMDc and BHDMDc can predict the vessel's response to unseen regular\nand irregular wave excitations. In conclusion, the study shows that HDMDc-based\nROMs are a viable data-driven alternative for system identification,\ndemonstrating for the first time their generalization capability for a sea\ncondition different from the training set, achieving high accuracy in\nreproducing vessel dynamics.",

To overcome this tradeoff, we introduce POEMS:\nProduct Of Experts for Interpretable Multiomics Integration using Sparse\nDecoding, an unsupervised probabilistic framework that preserves predictive\nperformance while providing interpretability. POEMS provides interpretability\nwithout linearizing any part of the network by 1) mapping features to latent\nfactors using sparse connections, which directly translates to biomarker\ndiscovery, 2) allowing for cross-omic associations through a shared latent\nspace using product of experts model, and 3) reporting contributions of each\nomic by a gating network that adaptively computes their influence in the\nrepresentation learning.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to\nsignificant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and\nCoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,\nknown as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these\nmodels often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While\ntraditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data\naugmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based\nmodifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely\nunexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,\nparticularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support\nand enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between\nthese augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to\nimprove generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such\nas CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that\nfocus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose\nAdding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces\nadversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations\nintroduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This\ndecoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually\ndiscriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently\noutperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and\ndomain generalization settings.

Unlike\ntraditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora\nand often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach\neliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of\nmulti-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named\nDMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different\ntransport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to\nobtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using\na novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and\nmaximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline\nis demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation\ncontext. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%\nand an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers\nand recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that\nSentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over\nalternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%\ngain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system\nseamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information,\ntraffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation\ndomain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents\nwithout costly manual labelling.",

All these models were evaluated on the performance\nmetrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings have led\nus to conclude that the usage of data dimensionality reduction methods results\nin skewed performance metric values, which results in wrongly estimating the\nactual performance of quantum machine learning models. There are several\nfactors, along with data dimensionality reduction methods, that worsen this\nproblem, such as characteristics of the datasets, classical to quantum\ninformation embedding methods, percentage of feature reduction, classical\ncomponents associated with quantum models, and structure of quantum machine\nlearning models. We consistently observed the difference in the accuracy range\nof 14% to 48% amongst these models, using data reduction and not using it.\nApart from this, our observations have shown that some data reduction methods\ntend to perform better for some specific data embedding methodologies and\nansatz constructions.",

Fairness notions commonly rely on protected\nattributes to assess potential biases. Here, the majority of literature focuses\non discrete setups regarding both target and protected attributes. The\nliterature on continuous attributes especially in conjunction with regression\n-- we refer to this as \\emph{continuous fairness} -- is scarce. A common\nstrategy is iterative null-space projection which as of now has only been\nexplored for linear models or embeddings such as obtained by a non-linear\nencoder.

The microservice call chain is\nabstracted as a directed graph, where multidimensional features of nodes and\nedges are used to construct a service topology representation, and graph\nconvolution is applied to aggregate features across nodes and model\ndependencies, capturing complex structural relationships among services. On\nthis basis, gated recurrent units are introduced to model the temporal\nevolution of call chains, and multi-layer stacking and concatenation operations\nare used to jointly obtain structural and temporal representations, improving\nthe ability to identify anomaly patterns. Furthermore, anomaly scoring\nfunctions at both the node and path levels are defined to achieve unified\nmodeling from local anomaly detection to global call chain tracing, which\nenables the identification of abnormal service nodes and the reconstruction of\npotential anomaly propagation paths. Sensitivity experiments are then designed\nfrom multiple dimensions, including hyperparameters, environmental\ndisturbances, and data distribution, to evaluate the framework, and results\nshow that it outperforms baseline methods in key metrics such as AUC, ACC,\nRecall, and F1-Score, maintaining high accuracy and stability under dynamic\ntopologies and complex environments.

This paper proposes\nan adaptive rate limiting strategy based on deep reinforcement learning that\ndynamically balances system throughput and service latency. We design a hybrid\narchitecture combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage\nActor-Critic (A3C) algorithms, modeling the rate limiting decision process as a\nMarkov Decision Process.

Artificial Neural Network models, a machine learning\ntool, were employed to assess the relative importance of these predictors and\nto identify hotspots of endemism.

    "abstract": "Solving inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is\ncentral to science and engineering, yet remains challenging when measurements\nare sparse, noisy, or when the underlying coefficients are high-dimensional or\ndiscontinuous. Existing deep learning approaches either require extensive\nlabeled datasets or are limited to specific measurement types, often leading to\nfailure in such regimes and restricting their practical applicability. Here, a\nnovel generative neural operator framework, IGNO, is introduced to overcome\nthese limitations. IGNO unifies the solution of inverse problems from both\npoint measurements and operator-valued data without labeled training pairs.\nThis framework encodes high-dimensional, potentially discontinuous coefficient\nfields into a low-dimensional latent space, which drives neural operator\ndecoders to reconstruct both coefficients and PDE solutions. Training relies\npurely on physics constraints through PDE residuals, while inversion proceeds\nvia efficient gradient-based optimization in latent space, accelerated by an a\npriori normalizing flow model. Across a diverse set of challenging inverse\nproblems, including recovery of discontinuous coefficients from solution-based\nmeasurements and the EIT problem with operator-based measurements, IGNO\nconsistently achieves accurate, stable, and scalable inversion even under\nsevere noise. It consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method under\nvarying noise levels and demonstrates strong generalization to\nout-of-distribution targets. These results establish IGNO as a unified and\npowerful framework for tackling challenging inverse problems across\ncomputational science domains.",

    "abstract": "Modern AI systems are increasingly constrained not by model capacity but by\nthe quality and diversity of their data. Despite growing emphasis on\ndata-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which\naccumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage. This\nresults in inefficient storage, costly labeling, and limited generalization. To\naddress this, this paper introduces \\ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data\ncollection as a closed-loop control problem. \\ac{FCDC} continuously\napproximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online\nprobabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on\nfeedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this\nfeedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and\nexploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from\naccumulating over time. Besides showcasing the controllability of \\ac{FCDC} on\na synthetic dataset, experiments on a real data stream show that \\ac{FCDC}\nproduces more balanced datasets by $\\SI{25.9}{\\percent}$ while reducing data\nstorage by $\\SI{39.8}{\\percent}$. These results demonstrate that data\ncollection itself can be actively controlled, transforming collection from a\npassive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the\ncore of data-centric AI.",

However, while various\nprompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus\nprimarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This\nleaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more\ngeneral and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively\ninvestigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details\nand process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings\nreveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues\nand seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,\nwe propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions\n(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems\nwith an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various\nopen-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image\nbenchmarks.

While empirical studies have\nexplored mitigation strategies, theoretical understanding of memorization\nremains limited. We address this gap through developing a dual-separation\nresult via two complementary perspectives: statistical estimation and network\napproximation. From the estimation side, we show that the ground-truth score\nfunction does not minimize the empirical denoising loss, creating a separation\nthat drives memorization.

This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework\nwhere an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors\nderived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a\npretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization\nstrategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization\n(PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection\nperformance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT\nbotnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with\nrespect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable\ndecline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original\nunquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in\nsize, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the\npracticality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.",

It\nis essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various\ninformation from multiple modalities. The main challenge is how to\nappropriately align and fuse the representations of different modalities into a\njoint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the\nKronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities\nand indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the\njoint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is\nunderexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the\ninteractions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution\nand marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel\ncopula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the\njoint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions\namong them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align\nthe marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a\nGaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint\ndistribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing\nmodalities.

However, current methods\noften overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on\nincreasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the\ndistance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --\nparticularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across\nvarying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is\nessential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a\nframework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner.

By\ncapturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse\nperiods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We\nfurther show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream\ntasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill\ndiscovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's\nrepertoire.

The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal\ndependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike\nvanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short\ntasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal\ngrounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process\nand supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than\nmerely replicating motion sequences.\n  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We\nshow that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized\nmodels, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level\nintent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object\nmanipulation.",

    "abstract": "The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains,\nleading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional\nmethods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this,\nwe formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework\nthat integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces\nspecialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine\ndesign candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the\naerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of\nthree key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems\nEngineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to\nconstruct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.\nThe Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical\nrequirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer\nleverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose\ncandidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and\nprovides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge\ngraph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the\nmanager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics\nsuch as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how\ncollaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can\nenhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.",

This limits autonomy and environmental\nawareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer\nstrategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel\nefficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic\nmissions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is\nhighlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition\nand digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables\nadaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and\ndecision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced\nPositioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation\ncapabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for\nmapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems\nsupport autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated\nsatellite swarm operations.

However, the proposed is not a probability\nfunction. We normalize it to calculate the probability and derive the\nclosed-form equation.

The results\nrevealed that the proposed distribution not only captures the fundamental\ncharacteristics of headway distribution but also provides physically meaningful\nparameters that describe the distribution shape of observed headways. Under\nheterogeneous flow on highways (i.e., uninterrupted traffic flow), the proposed\ndistribution outperforms other candidate distributions.

In contrast,\npretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated\nstrong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their\npotential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally\ndifferent from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly\n(F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities\nthrough two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss\nthat fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous\ntime points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module\nthat retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on\nthem. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference\ntime, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates.\nBy combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap\nbetween robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction.\nExtensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones\nshow that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a\nscalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.",

Recent test-time adaptation methods based on\nbatch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but\nthey often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained\nto specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration\n(AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation\ndistributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the\nfull shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures\nemploying BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of\nestimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a\nrobust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our\nmethod leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling\nunsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C,\nCIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR\nachieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing\ntest-time adaptation baselines.

While\nrecent advances in generative models offer a promising way for inverse design,\nmost approaches require large datasets and must be retrained for every new\ntarget property. Here, we introduce the EGMOF (Efficient Generation of MOFs), a\nhybrid diffusion-transformer framework that overcomes these limitations through\na modular, descriptor-mediated workflow. EGMOF decomposes inverse design into\ntwo steps: (1) a one-dimensional diffusion model (Prop2Desc) that maps desired\nproperties to chemically meaningful descriptors followed by (2) a transformer\nmodel (Desc2MOF) that generates structures from these descriptors. This modular\nhybrid design enables minimal retraining and maintains high accuracy even under\nsmall-data conditions. On a hydrogen uptake dataset, EGMOF achieved over 95%\nvalidity and 84% hit rate, representing significant improvements of up to 57%\nin validity and 14% in hit rate compared to existing methods, while remaining\neffective with only 1,000 training samples. Moreover, our model successfully\nperformed conditional generation across 29 diverse property datasets, including\nCoREMOF, QMOF, and text-mined experimental datasets, whereas previous models\nhave not.

    "abstract": "Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has achieved great success on\nvarious tasks. However, its underlying working mechanism is yet unclear. In\nthis paper, we first provide the tightest bounds based on the widely adopted\nassumption of conditional independence. Further, we relax the conditional\nindependence assumption to a more practical assumption of augmentation overlap\nand derive the asymptotically closed bounds for the downstream performance. Our\nproposed augmentation overlap theory hinges on the insight that the support of\ndifferent intra-class samples will become more overlapped under aggressive data\naugmentations, thus simply aligning the positive samples (augmented views of\nthe same sample) could make contrastive learning cluster intra-class samples\ntogether. Moreover, from the newly derived augmentation overlap perspective, we\ndevelop an unsupervised metric for the representation evaluation of contrastive\nlearning, which aligns well with the downstream performance almost without\nrelying on additional modules.

    "abstract": "Computational antibody design holds immense promise for therapeutic\ndiscovery, yet existing generative models are fundamentally limited by two core\nchallenges: (i) a lack of dynamical consistency, which yields physically\nimplausible structures, and (ii) poor generalization due to data scarcity and\nstructural bias. We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to\nenforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative\ntrajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed\nmanifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising\nscores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This\nphysics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological\npriors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework.\nRigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a\nnew state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean\nSquare Deviation of 0.99 {\\AA} when superposing on the variable region, a 25%\nimprovement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest\nreported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored\nin the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers\nconsistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root\nMean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain\nAmino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%). By\naligning generative dynamics with physical laws, FP-AbDiff enhances robustness\nand generalizability, establishing a principled approach for physically\nfaithful and functionally viable antibody design.",

    "abstract": "The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and\nenvironment configurations in search of improved system performance. With\napplication domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management,\nco-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems.\nHowever, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under\nhigh-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency\nwhen addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these\nchallenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and\nsample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically\nrelevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we\nintroduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables\nDiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while\nsatisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.\nSecond, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the\nreinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts\nto evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.\nTogether, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when\nvalidated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including\nwarehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our\nmethod consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39%\nhigher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples.

    "abstract": "Modern artificial intelligence has revolutionized our ability to extract rich\nand versatile data representations across scientific disciplines. Yet, the\nstatistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled,\ncausing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare\nsignals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,\ncreating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine\nthis gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods\noperating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;\nlocality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote\nefficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of\nself-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation\nspace around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these\nprinciples, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained\nwithin a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the\nlikelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,\nanomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms\nthat drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional\nproblems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion\ndetection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the\nnatural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing\nonly a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous\nlocations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring\nboth the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.",

Schizophrenia, a complex disorder with diverse\nsymptoms including disorganized speech and social withdrawal, demands tools\nthat capture symptom severity and provide clinically meaningful insights beyond\nbinary diagnosis. Here, we present an interpretable framework that leverages\narticulatory speech features through eigenspectra difference plots and a\nweighted sum with exponential decay (WSED) to quantify vocal tract\ncoordination. Eigenspectra plots effectively distinguished complex from simpler\ncoordination patterns, and WSED scores reliably separated these groups, with\nambiguity confined to a narrow range near zero. Importantly, WSED scores\ncorrelated not only with overall BPRS severity but also with the balance\nbetween positive and negative symptoms, reflecting more complex coordination in\nsubjects with pronounced positive symptoms and the opposite trend for stronger\nnegative symptoms.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of open-access (OA) publications has intensified the\nchallenge of identifying relevant scientific papers. Due to privacy constraints\nand limited access to user interaction data, recent efforts have shifted toward\ncontent-based recommendation, which relies solely on textual information.\nHowever, existing models typically treat papers as unstructured text,\nneglecting their discourse organization and thereby limiting semantic\ncompleteness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose\nOMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective,\nMethod, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning,\nand structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style\nsummarization module converts raw papers into structured and\ndiscourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives\nalign semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels.\nThe final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through\ncontextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly\nconstructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in\nPrecision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that\nQA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete\nrepresentations. Overall, OMRC-MR provides a unified and interpretable\ncontent-based paradigm for scientific paper recommendation, advancing\ntrustworthy and privacy-aware scholarly information retrieval.",

In ancient times,\nphilosophers and historians debated on how to evaluate, increase, and secure\nthe reliability of oracle predictions, particularly those from Delphi, which\npertained to matters of state. Today, we refer to data carriers for automatic\nmachines as oracles, but establishing a secure channel between these oracles\nand the real world still represents a challenge. Despite numerous efforts, this\nproblem remains mostly unsolved, and the recent advent of blockchain oracles\nhas added a layer of complexity because of the decentralization of blockchains.\nThis paper conceptually connects Delphic and modern blockchain oracles,\ndeveloping a comparative framework. Leveraging blockchain oracle taxonomy,\nlexical analysis is also performed on 167 Delphic queries to shed light on the\nrelationship between oracle answer quality and question type. The presented\nframework aims first at revealing commonalities between classical and\ncomputational oracles and then at enriching the oracle analysis within each\nfield. This study contributes to the computer science literature by proposing\nstrategies to improve the reliability of blockchain oracles based on insights\nfrom Delphi and to classical literature by introducing a framework that can\nalso be applied to interpret and classify other ancient oracular mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a cornerstone algorithm for\ninformation retrieval, recommendation systems, and machine learning\napplications. While x86-based architectures have historically dominated this\ndomain, the increasing adoption of ARM-based servers in industry presents a\ncritical need for ANNS solutions optimized on ARM architectures. A naive port\nof existing x86 ANNS algorithms to ARM platforms results in a substantial\nperformance deficit, failing to leverage the unique capabilities of the\nunderlying hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce KScaNN, a novel\nANNS algorithm co-designed for the Kunpeng 920 ARM architecture. KScaNN\nembodies a holistic approach that synergizes sophisticated, data aware\nalgorithmic refinements with carefully-designed hardware specific\noptimizations. Its core contributions include: 1) novel algorithmic techniques,\nincluding a hybrid intra-cluster search strategy and an improved PQ residual\ncalculation method, which optimize the search process at a higher level; 2) an\nML-driven adaptive search module that provides adaptive, per-query tuning of\nsearch parameters, eliminating the inefficiencies of static configurations; and\n3) highly-optimized SIMD kernels for ARM that maximize hardware utilization for\nthe critical distance computation workloads. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that KScaNN not only closes the performance gap but establishes a\nnew standard, achieving up to a 1.63x speedup over the fastest x86-based\nsolution. This work provides a definitive blueprint for achieving\nleadership-class performance for vector search on modern ARM architectures and\nunderscores",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems in multi-behavior domains, such as advertising and\ne-commerce, aim to guide users toward high-value but inherently sparse\nconversions. Leveraging auxiliary behaviors (e.g., clicks, likes, shares) is\ntherefore essential. Recent progress on generative recommendations has brought\nnew possibilities for multi-behavior sequential recommendation. However,\nexisting generative approaches face two significant challenges: 1) Inadequate\nSequence Modeling: capture the complex, cross-level dependencies within user\nbehavior sequences, and 2) Lack of Suitable Datasets: publicly available\nmulti-behavior recommendation datasets are almost exclusively derived from\ne-commerce platforms, limiting the validation of feasibility in other domains,\nwhile also lacking sufficient side information for semantic ID generation. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel generative framework, GAMER\n(Generative Augmentation and Multi-lEvel behavior modeling for Recommendation),\nbuilt upon a decoder-only backbone. GAMER introduces a cross-level interaction\nlayer to capture hierarchical dependencies among behaviors and a sequential\naugmentation strategy that enhances robustness in training. To further advance\nthis direction, we collect and release ShortVideoAD, a large-scale\nmulti-behavior dataset from a mainstream short-video platform, which differs\nfundamentally from existing e-commerce datasets and provides pretrained\nsemantic IDs for research on generative methods. Extensive experiments show\nthat GAMER consistently outperforms both discriminative and generative\nbaselines across multiple metrics.",

Many real-world scenarios require robots to\nnavigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by\ntasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding\ncollisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in\ndecentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold\nconstraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a\nmanifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for\ndecentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints\nto capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a\ndecentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate\nmotion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions\nabout other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse\nmanifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional\nmulti-agent manipulation problems. Experiments show that our method outperforms\nexisting constrained motion planners and operates at speeds suitable for\nreal-world applications.

To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences\nQuantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user\npersonalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation\nFrameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference\nconflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically\nassumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates\nboth users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment,\nallowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts.\nPreferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose\nstrength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's\nproperties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic\ncase study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting\npreferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment\ntask. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base\nscores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and\ncontextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and\ncontext-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work\nadvances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to\ndata-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Robust 3D semantic occupancy is crucial for legged/humanoid robots, yet most\nsemantic scene completion (SSC) systems target wheeled platforms with\nforward-facing sensors. We present OneOcc, a vision-only panoramic SSC\nframework designed for gait-introduced body jitter and 360{\\deg} continuity.\nOneOcc combines: (i) Dual-Projection fusion (DP-ER) to exploit the annular\npanorama and its equirectangular unfolding, preserving 360{\\deg} continuity and\ngrid alignment; (ii) Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) to reason in Cartesian and\ncylindrical-polar spaces, reducing discretization bias and sharpening\nfree/occupied boundaries; (iii) a lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D\nfor dynamic multi-scale fusion and better long-range/occlusion reasoning; and\n(iv) plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) learning feature-level\nmotion correction without extra sensors. We also release two panoramic\noccupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc (real quadruped, first-person 360{\\deg}) and\nHuman360Occ (H3O) (CARLA human-ego 360{\\deg} with RGB, Depth, semantic\noccupancy; standardized within-/cross-city splits). OneOcc sets new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA): on QuadOcc it beats strong vision baselines and\npopular LiDAR ones; on H3O it gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08\n(cross-city).

    "abstract": "Research indicates that humans can mistakenly assume that robots and humans\nhave the same field of view (FoV), possessing an inaccurate mental model of\nrobots. This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot\ncollaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks\nabout out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a\nchance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned\ntasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we\npropose four FoV indicators in augmented reality (AR) and conducted a user\nhuman-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in terms of accuracy,\nconfidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum\nfrom egocentric (robot's eye and head space) to allocentric (task space).\nResults showed that the allocentric blocks at the task space had the highest\naccuracy with a delay in interpreting the robot's FoV. The egocentric indicator\nof deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased\naccuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive\nload remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to\napply our AR indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models\nwith robots' vision capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key\nresearch verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics,\nwith Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and\nenabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of\nthese verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper\nintroduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for\nanalyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through\nLLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain\nknowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting\nnatively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time\nseries data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2\nCLI tools (\"ros2 bag list\" or \"ros2 bag info\"), as well as the ability to\nfilter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP\nserver, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling\nwith different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source\n(through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling\ncapabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both\nproprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that\nthere is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude\nSonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that\nthere are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool\ndescription schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools\navailable to the models.

Compared\nto PID control, joint torques in multi-object grasping are reduced by 31.19%,\nsignificantly improves force-sensing capability while preventing overload\nduring collisions.

The findings reveal rich insights into design-relevant\nvalues-including adaptivity, acceptance, and efficacy-that are core to support\nfor individuals with social anxiety.

To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a\nlightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance\nfrom foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs\na fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual\ninstructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance\nembeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space,\nallowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief,\ntargeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language\nmodel-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence\nis low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves\nrelevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions.\nExtensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse\npolicy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task\nsuccess rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that\nGUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping.\nOverall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade,\nrather than replace, validated robot policies.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn\ndiverse behaviors without relying on external rewards. However, current methods\noften overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on\nincreasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the\ndistance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --\nparticularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across\nvarying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is\nessential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a\nframework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key\nidea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space,\nthereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By\ncapturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse\nperiods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We\nfurther show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream\ntasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill\ndiscovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's\nrepertoire.

    "abstract": "Human-robot cooperation is essential in environments such as warehouses and\nretail stores, where workers frequently handle deformable objects like paper,\nbags, and fabrics. Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains\ndifficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the\nneed for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the\ntask of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem\ninvolving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.\nSuccess is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly\nwrapped package with clean folds and no tears.\n  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task\nplanner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid\nimitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is\na Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from\nhuman demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal\ndependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike\nvanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short\ntasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal\ngrounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process\nand supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than\nmerely replicating motion sequences.\n  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We\nshow that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized\nmodels, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level\nintent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object\nmanipulation.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of cislunar activities, including lunar landings, the Lunar\nGateway, and in-space refueling stations, requires advances in cost-efficient\ntrajectory design and reliable integration of navigation and remote sensing.\nTraditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high\npropellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no\ncoverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental\nawareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer\nstrategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel\nefficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic\nmissions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is\nhighlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition\nand digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables\nadaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and\ndecision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced\nPositioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation\ncapabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for\nmapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems\nsupport autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated\nsatellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable\nframework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic\npresence.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various\nscientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications.\nDespite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order\nto achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this\ncontext is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or\nfalse answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic\nknowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what\nis the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,\nclassical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight\nfundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,\nchallenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we\ndevelop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating\nwhether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world\npopulations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social\nbehavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not\nseem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the\ncontext of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that\nlanguage models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer\n1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional\n(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also\nlimited.",

    "abstract": "Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet\nare inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema\nmapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for\nindividual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental\nlimitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning\npatterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a\nmulti-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition\ninto specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,\nand reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent\ncontexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits\npersist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%\ndiscovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning\nenhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%\nfor analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide\nwhen and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while\nenabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.",

For instance, repeated\nuse may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may\nrestore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or\nGaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world\nsettings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can\ncompute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not\nprovide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting\nthe ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of\nparticular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in\ndeveloping just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level\neffects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In\nthis paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored\nto the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.\nWe then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization\nand population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret\nand minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning\nphysical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our\nmethods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high\nstatistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly\nincreasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while\naccounting for individual behavioral dynamics.

On heterogeneous speckle-cyst\nphantoms, the network reduces image-domain MSE by 90 percent, boosts PSNR by\n6.7 dB, and raises SSIM to 0.965 compared with the narrow-band input. It also\nsharpens point-target rows in a completely unseen resolution phantom,\ndemonstrating strong out-of-distribution generalisation without sacrificing\nframe rate or phase information. These results indicate that a purely software\nupgrade can endow installed narrow-band probes with broadband-like performance,\npotentially widening access to high-resolution ultrasound in\nresource-constrained settings.",

    "abstract": "Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between\nspecific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing\nthat a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to\nexplore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with\npretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential\nmeans for scaling the description of data use cases in the published\nliterature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of\ntraining datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we\napply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case\nlabels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also\nintroduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our\nmethods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score\nof .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously\ndefined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers\nrelated to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure,\nand the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and\nmitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties,\nsuch as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by\ndata augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on\ntransformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a\ntraining methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire\ninput space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training\nset to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which\nwe refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce\nfunctional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the\ntraining dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised\nmanner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled\nvirtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across\ndatasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently\noutperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On\npopular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%\ntop-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data\naugmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray\ndataset.",

Substantial progress has been\nmade towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such\nagents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing\ncoherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,\nan AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended\nobjective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of\nparallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before\nsynthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos\nuses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis\nagent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to\ncoherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively\nexecuting an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.\nKosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,\nensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of\nstatements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a\nsingle 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own\nresearch time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number\nof valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles\n(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that\nspan metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.\nThree discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or\nunpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four\nmake novel contributions to the scientific literature.",

Since comprehensive\nconventional physical testing is impractical due to cost and safety concerns,\nVirtual Testing Environments (VTE) can be adopted as an alternative. Comparing\nVTE-generated sensor outputs against their real-world analogues can be a strong\nindication that the VTE accurately represents reality. Correspondingly, this\nwork explores a comprehensive experimental approach to finding evaluation\nmetrics suitable for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans. The\nmetrics were tested in terms of sensitivity and accuracy with different noise,\ndensity, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. From comparing\nthe metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best\nacross all cases. In the second step of the research, a Virtual Testing\nEnvironment was generated using real LiDAR scan data. The data was collected in\na controlled environment with only static objects using an instrumented vehicle\nequipped with LiDAR, IMU and cameras. Simulated LiDAR scans were generated from\nthe VTEs using the same pose as real LiDAR scans. The simulated and LiDAR scans\nwere compared in terms of model perception and geometric similarity. Actual and\nsimulated LiDAR scans have a similar semantic segmentation output with a mIoU\nof 21\\% with corrected intensity and an average density aware chamfer distance\n(DCD) of 0.63. This indicates a slight difference in the geometric properties\nof simulated and real LiDAR scans and a significant difference between model\noutputs. During the comparison, density-aware chamfer distance was found to be\nthe most correlated among the metrics with perception methods.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event\ncamera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains\nmore than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions,\nincluding seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration.\nEvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,\nproviding an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth\nlearning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised\nlearning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We\nfurther demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability\nto generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for\nframe-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and\nmitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties,\nsuch as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by\ndata augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on\ntransformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a\ntraining methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire\ninput space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training\nset to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which\nwe refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce\nfunctional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the\ntraining dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised\nmanner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled\nvirtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across\ndatasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently\noutperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On\npopular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%\ntop-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data\naugmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray\ndataset.",

Surprisingly, the nnU Net model trained on the initial 60 instances\nperformed better than the network trained on an offline-augmented dataset of\n360 cases. Hypothetically, the offline augmentations introduced artificial\nanatomical variances or intensity distributions, reducing generalization. In\ncontrast, the original dataset, when paired with nnU Net's robust online\naugmentation procedures, maintained realistic variability and produced better\nresults. The study achieved a Dice score of 0.84 for whole tumor segmentation.\nThese findings highlight the significance of data quality and proper\naugmentation approaches in constructing accurate, generalizable medical picture\nsegmentation models, particularly for under-represented locations.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for\nautomatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic\nspatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this\nproblem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,\nadvancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions\nthat reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic\nscenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to\nlearn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,\ndegrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment\nbetween the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for\neffective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and\nvision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.\nThis shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D\nscenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address\nthis, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse\ntools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate\nalignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed\ninstructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world\nenvironments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge\nby 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with\nLEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods.\nAcross all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in\ngenerating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.",

However, such systems are\nvulnerable to click fraud and other manipulations (i.e., corruption), where\nbots or paid click farms inject corrupted feedback that misleads the learning\nprocess and degrades user experience. In this paper, we propose MSUCB, a robust\nalgorithm that incorporates a novel mean-of-medians estimator, which to our\nknowledge is applied to bandits with corruption setting for the first time.\nThis estimator behaves like a standard mean in the absence of corruption, so no\ncost is paid for robustness. Under corruption, the median step filters out\noutliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value.\nUpdating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence\nin experiments. Hence, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the absence\nof corruption and degrades gracefully under corruptions, with regret increasing\nonly by an additive term tied to the total corruption. Comprehensive and\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets further demonstrate that our\napproach consistently outperforms prior methods while maintaining strong\nrobustness.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various\nscientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications.\nDespite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order\nto achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this\ncontext is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or\nfalse answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic\nknowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what\nis the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,\nclassical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight\nfundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,\nchallenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we\ndevelop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating\nwhether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world\npopulations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social\nbehavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not\nseem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the\ncontext of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that\nlanguage models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer\n1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional\n(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also\nlimited.",

    "abstract": "Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained opinion mining\napproach that identifies and classifies opinions associated with specific\nentities (aspects) or their categories within a sentence. Despite its rapid\ngrowth and broad potential, ABSA research and resources remain concentrated in\ncommercial domains, leaving analytical needs unmet in high-demand yet\nlow-resource areas such as education and healthcare. Domain adaptation\nchallenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive\nin-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas.\nMoreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly\nrigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent\nthe performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through\nthree contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text\nSimilarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates\nrealistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation\nwith traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present\nthe first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs;\n<7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education\nreview ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and\nweight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask\nfine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling\n1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark\nresults with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first\npublic set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in\nlow-resource domains.",

    "abstract": "In the era of AI-driven science and engineering, we often want to design\ndiscrete objects in silico according to user-specified properties. For example,\nwe may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a\ncircuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific\napplications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over\ndesign variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective\noptimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may\nonly loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve\nmaximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are\nunable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and\ndemonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm,\nDecomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any\ndecomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make\noptimization more efficient. At its core, DADO employs a soft-factorized\n\"search distribution\" -- a learned generative model -- for efficient navigation\nof the search space, invoking graph message-passing to coordinate optimization\nacross linked factors.",

Correspondingly, this\nwork explores a comprehensive experimental approach to finding evaluation\nmetrics suitable for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans. The\nmetrics were tested in terms of sensitivity and accuracy with different noise,\ndensity, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. From comparing\nthe metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best\nacross all cases. In the second step of the research, a Virtual Testing\nEnvironment was generated using real LiDAR scan data. The data was collected in\na controlled environment with only static objects using an instrumented vehicle\nequipped with LiDAR, IMU and cameras. Simulated LiDAR scans were generated from\nthe VTEs using the same pose as real LiDAR scans. The simulated and LiDAR scans\nwere compared in terms of model perception and geometric similarity. Actual and\nsimulated LiDAR scans have a similar semantic segmentation output with a mIoU\nof 21\\% with corrected intensity and an average density aware chamfer distance\n(DCD) of 0.63. This indicates a slight difference in the geometric properties\nof simulated and real LiDAR scans and a significant difference between model\noutputs.

Handling this complexity and ensuring\nconsistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a\nstructured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However,\nexisting Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique\nchallenges of agricultural applications.\n  Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework,\nwhich can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of\nautonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core\nelements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured\nmethod for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters\nusing concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model\nderived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process\nlayer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative\nverification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical\nscenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness\nand consistency.\n  Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating\nunambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD.

Yet, this new language lacks\nsemantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With\nthe purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the\nworld, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of\ntranslating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we\nargue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a\nneurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the\nneural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic\nAI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are\nsatisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction\napproaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a\nframework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural\nnetworks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various\nexisting approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how\nlogical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we\nreview some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for\nneural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our\nframework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic\nencoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature\nsearch, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been\nmade towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such\nagents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing\ncoherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,\nan AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended\nobjective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of\nparallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before\nsynthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos\nuses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis\nagent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to\ncoherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively\nexecuting an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.\nKosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,\nensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of\nstatements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a\nsingle 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own\nresearch time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number\nof valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles\n(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that\nspan metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.\nThree discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or\nunpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four\nmake novel contributions to the scientific literature.",

To get around the\nconstraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack\ndynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then\nshow that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena.

    "abstract": "Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet,\ndeveloping effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to\nheterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple\nscales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN\nand TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to\ngradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,\ncurrent architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature\nprocessing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with\nquadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component\nprocessing that prevents iterative representation refinement and\ncross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce\nOrion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)\nmulti-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)\nblock-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for\nscalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style\nmemory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across\ndiverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance\nwhile scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new\nstandard for efficient tabular in-context learning.

    "abstract": "Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM\ncontext, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,\nresulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the\ncurrent turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This\ntrade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,\nwe propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact\nmemory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses\nthe user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform\nsearch actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for\nsolving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn\ninteractions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize\nthis workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that\njointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of\nMemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of\ntrajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level\nadvantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as\nSearch-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines\non seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher\neven outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance\nbetween information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and\nlower computational overhead.

This paper briefly\ndescribes an LLM-supported method for semi-automated generation of formal\nknowledge representations that combine human readability with machine\ninterpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative\nRepresentation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language\nmodels can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and\nmathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized\nknowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an\n``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to\nfacilitate knowledge transfer.

At the same\ntime, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior\nwork has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if\ninference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer\nsolutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we\nintroduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.\nWe demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads\ncan all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that\nhad been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter\n-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper\nintroduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked\ntogether with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and\nsemantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache\nlocality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can\nenable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we\ndemonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two\ndistinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be\noptimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called\nlost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span\nquery on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock\ninference server using an 8b model.",

With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to\nexplain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works\nsuggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be\nattributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance\npropagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find\nimages that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are\nlargely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered\nconcepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting\nthe accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.\n  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept\nRelevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a\nmultimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive\nnames to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that\ntranslate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To\nensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the\nsemantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and\nexplanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,\noffering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries\nfor non-technical stakeholders.\n  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a\nVGG16 model.

Our\nresults reveal a \"collaboration gap\": models that perform well solo often\ndegrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break\ndown dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well\nalone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting\nwith the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a \"relay inference\"\napproach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,\nclosing much of the gap.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse\napplications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.",

However,\ntransformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention\nmodule (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which\nseverely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is\ncritical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under\nhigh request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.\n  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with\nlinear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent\ncomputation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we\nintroduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer\nattention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.\nThese models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained\nreasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing\nless critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.\n  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with\ndifferent SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as\nmore Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant\nof Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,\nachieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the\nproduction-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning\nperformance.

To address these, we propose Federated Attention\n(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention\nmechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and\ncomputational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local\nself-attention over their own token representations while periodically\nexchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer\nblocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private\nprompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual\nrepresentation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across\nprivate data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight\nprovides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated\noptimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this\nframework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within\nparticipants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error\npropagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the\nfundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation\nefficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of\nparticipants.

We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile\nmanagement affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We\ntest various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits\nsuperior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage\noperators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price\nstabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price\ndynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as\nvolatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices.\nRemarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained\nwithout explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the\nsimulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage\nthresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market\nresilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks.\nFor example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more\noften if a threshold is in place.",

    "abstract": "Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in\neducation, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge\nTracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational\nquestions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing\nKT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill\ntags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important\nsource of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while\nlimiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing\n(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using\npretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories\nand question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in\nboth behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves\nperformance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better\nto cold-start questions and users.

This ensures\nsemantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite\nlayers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring\nfine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our\ntraining-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,\nenhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and\nfidelity.

To address this, offline RL algorithms\ntypically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically\ncategorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show\nthat each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints\ntend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,\nthough least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior\npolicy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint\nthat restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of\nneighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds\nextrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also\napproximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.\nMoreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism\nby adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ\ndata quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood\nconstraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop\na simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning\n(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.\nEmpirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL\nbenchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited\ndata.",

    "abstract": "Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using\nLarge AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with\nmultimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will\nlead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals,\nretain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and\nenvironments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G\nnetworks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a\nmethod for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite\nits rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the\nfoundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a\nuniversally accepted definition.\n  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G\nnetworks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case\nthat applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic\nAI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress\nfrom workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design\npatterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then\ndescribed to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These\ntheorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus\non RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how\ntime-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based\nautonomous decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed\nacross institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of\ndiscriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in\npart, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.\nCausal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,\ndiscrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of\nbiomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms\nrather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological\nfoundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal\nrepresentation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and\ncounterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating\nclinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,\ncancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological\nmonitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting\nprescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific\nCausal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with\nintegration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph\nneural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,\nincluding computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,\nvalidation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond\ncross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal\nterminology without rigorous evidentiary support.

To better handle the interdependency across location and routing\ndecisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism\ndesigned to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages.

WVSC-D first encodes original video frames as semantic\nframes and then conducts video coding based on such compact representations,\nenabling the video coding in semantic level rather than pixel level. Moreover,\nto further reduce the communication overhead, a reference semantic frame is\nintroduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in common video coding\nmethods. At the receiver, DDMFC is proposed to generate compensated current\nsemantic frame by a two-stage conditional diffusion process. With both the\nreference frame transmission and DDMFC frame compensation, the bandwidth\nefficiency improves with satisfying video transmission performance.\nExperimental results verify the performance gain of WVSC-D over other DL-based\nmethods e.g. DVSC about 1.8 dB in terms of PSNR.",

This study proposes a novel\nframework that structurally imitates the FOMC's collective decision-making\nprocess by modeling multiple large language models(LLMs) as interacting agents.\nEach agent begins with a distinct initial belief and produces a prediction\nbased on both qualitative policy texts and quantitative macroeconomic\nindicators.

To enhance interpretability, we introduce a latent variable\nrepresenting each agent's underlying belief(e.g., hawkish or dovish), and we\ntheoretically demonstrate how this belief mediates the perception of input\ninformation and interaction dynamics. Empirical results show that this\ndebate-based approach significantly outperforms standard LLMs-based baselines\nin prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit modeling of beliefs provides\ninsights into how individual perspectives and social influence shape collective\npolicy forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated great\npotential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models\n(LLMs), achieving remarkable progress in domains such as mathematics and\nprogramming where standard answers are available. However, for open-ended tasks\nlacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction\nfollowing), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,\nthereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a\nkey question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended\ntasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the\nopen domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose\nthe existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended\ntasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice\nReformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended\ndata into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even\nin the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM\nperformance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,\nour VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the\nbaseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for\nrepresentation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as\nTransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent\nlimitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.\nIn this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model\nthat challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a\ncompact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear\nSpherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as\na hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments\non three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate\nthat SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean\ncounterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237\nand CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We\nprovide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing\nthat this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to\ncomprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,\nwe prove that the spherical geometry creates an \"inherently hard negative\nsampling\" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the\nmodel to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our\nfindings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an\nimplementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for\ngeometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful\nand stable KGE models.",

To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical\ntask-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable\nsubgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled\nby an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the\ntree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent\nnodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent\nnode retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and\nshares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on\nthe WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently\noutperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.\nNotably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5\n72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.",

    "abstract": "The development of clinically reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems\nfor mammography is hindered by profound heterogeneity in data quality, metadata\nstandards, and population distributions across public datasets. This\nheterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the\ngeneralizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We\npresent MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias\nquantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection,\nimage processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies\nmetadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive\nreview of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography\ndatasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to\nthree heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify\nsubstantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence.\nCritically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models\ntrained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation\ncompared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and\nmitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training\ncorpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain\ngeneralization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for\nbias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and\nadvancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across\ndiverse patient populations and clinical settings.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language model agents offer the promise of\nautomating end-to-end software development from natural language requirements.\nHowever, existing approaches largely adopt linear, waterfall-style pipelines,\nwhich oversimplify the iterative nature of real-world development and struggle\nwith complex, large-scale projects. To address these limitations, we propose\nEvoDev, an iterative software development framework inspired by feature-driven\ndevelopment. EvoDev decomposes user requirements into a set of user-valued\nfeatures and constructs a Feature Map, a directed acyclic graph that explicitly\nmodels dependencies between features. Each node in the feature map maintains\nmulti-level information, including business logic, design, and code, which is\npropagated along dependencies to provide context for subsequent development\niterations. We evaluate EvoDev on challenging Android development tasks and\nshow that it outperforms the best-performing baseline, Claude Code, by a\nsubstantial margin of 56.8%, while improving single-agent performance by\n16.0%-76.6% across different base LLMs, highlighting the importance of\ndependency modeling, context propagation, and workflow-aware agent design for\ncomplex software projects. Our work summarizes practical insights for designing\niterative, LLM-driven development frameworks and informs future training of\nbase LLMs to better support iterative software development.",

    "abstract": "Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications\nin cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical\nstandard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently\nsubjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to\nautomate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and\nefficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network\narchitectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal\npatterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current\nmodels often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially\nwhen dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in\nbiomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM\narchitecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound\nrecordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the\nH-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.\nExtensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a\npublic benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed\nmodel achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a\ntest accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.",

Current studies have\nproposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation\nfor embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by\nleveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly\ntrained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,\nshowing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial\nembedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for\nsome queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal\nenvironments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal\nmultimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

Causal inference, which focuses on\ndetermining the directionality and strength of interactions between variables\nrather than merely relying on correlations, is considered a logical approach\nfor inferring biological networks. Existing methods for causal structure\ninference typically assume that causal relationships between variables can be\nrepresented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, this assumption is at\nodds with the reality of widespread feedback loops in biological systems,\nmaking these methods unsuitable for direct use in biological network inference.\nIn this study, we propose a new framework named SCALD (Structural CAusal model\nfor Loop Diagram), which employs a nonlinear structure equation model and a\nstable feedback loop conditional constraint through continuous optimization to\ninfer causal regulatory relationships under feedback loops. We observe that\nSCALD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring both transcriptional\nregulatory networks and signaling transduction networks. SCALD has\nirreplaceable advantages in identifying feedback regulation. Through\ntranscription factor (TF) perturbation data analysis, we further validate the\naccuracy and sensitivity of SCALD. Additionally, SCALD facilitates the\ndiscovery of previously unknown regulatory relationships, which we have\nsubsequently confirmed through ChIP-seq data analysis. Furthermore, by\nutilizing SCALD, we infer the key driver genes that facilitate the\ntransformation from colon inflammation to cancer by examining the dynamic\nchanges within regulatory networks during the process.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for\ncooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized\nexecution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the\ndecomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to\nagents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited\nto the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned\nCooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for\nlearning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main\nchallenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove\nthe correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of\nlearned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.\nExperiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,\ne.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and\nshort-circuiting tasks.",

Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by\nenabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear\ndecision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions.

Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate\nthat FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal\ncorrelations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly\nreducing communication overhead.

In order to\nunderstand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as\nexpected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries\nto probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple\nLLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples\nthe space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to\ncreate realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our\nevaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using\nLLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge\ntreatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies\non inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation\nLLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's\nKappa $\\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs\nyield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and\nraces.

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when\ndifferent modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term\nmodality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative\nuncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality\nfollowing, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into\nhow MLLMs resolve conflicting information.",

    "abstract": "Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible\nlearning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the\nStructurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel\ncomputational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the\nmorphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates\non a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local\nprediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning\nmechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the\ntemporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned\nexpectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically\nmigrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This\ndual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information\n(synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources\n(network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole\nreinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture\ncan successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The\nnetwork's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis\nwas sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while\ncontinual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after\nachieving success resulted in a stable policy.

    "abstract": "Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies\non large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However,\nthis one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper\ncontextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their\nbehavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to\nlanguage (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent\ncapable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal\nrepresentations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We\nintroduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such\nbidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly\ntrained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from\nlanguage (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying\nsemantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a\nself-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data\nthrough an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby\nimproving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on\npick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY\nimproves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust\nlanguage-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

These\napproaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but\noverlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,\nwhich are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human\nliterature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention \"keyword A\" and\n\"keyword B\" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.\nAdditionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using\nthe model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the\nscientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established\nresearch. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework\nto address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures\nkeyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven\nideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to\niteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A\ncritic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by\nproviding continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas.

    "abstract": "Agentic LLM applications interleave LLM generation requests with tool calls.\nThese tool calls break the continuity of the workflow by creating pauses\nbetween LLM requests, bringing many challenges for the serving system,\nespecially under multi-turn scenarios. Each pause potentially causes KV cache\neviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the\nfollowing LLM request. Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem\nbecomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs. Previous\nworks either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV\ncache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of\na multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases\nper-request latency.\n  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for\nmulti-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with\nprogram-level scheduling. By predicting tool call durations in agentic\nworkflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a\ntime-to-live value based on total turn number. When combined with program-level\nfirst-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves\nmulti-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic\nworkflows. By modeling the variability of tool call and agent program\ncontinuity, Continuum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation on\nreal-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B models\nshows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times,\nand remains performant across different hardware setups and DRAM offloading\nschemes.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its\nearly diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on\nmultimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising\nresults by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most\nexisting approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while\noverlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In\naddition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead\nto biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and\nConsistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The\nproposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to\ncompensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and\nmodality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific\nrepresentations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to\nexplicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental\nresults on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior\ndiagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.",

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is\nensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected\nautonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control\nframework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic\n(SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model\nthe dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and\ntemporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a\nrobust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal\ncontrol through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the\nsystem to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with\nobjectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring\nsafety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated\nusing a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating\ndifferent traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%\nreduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to\ntraditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs\nimproved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types.\nThese findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for\nreal-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.",

Current techniques\nfor strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,\nlimiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring\npurposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for\nSLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning\n(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL\napproaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense\nframe-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point\ntrajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.\n  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly\naccessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to\ngenerate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with\nground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our\nevaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a\nmean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.\n  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation\nwith our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean\ndifference (95\\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).\nIncorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of\nthe models in quantifying abnormal deformation.

Plant phenotyping plays\na vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits\nsuch as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional\nplant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often\ndestructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful\nframeworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of\nmulti-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable\nnon-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their\npromise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct\nthe entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,\nincreases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction\nframework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment\nAnything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean\nstrawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate\ngeometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With\na background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate\nimportant plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN\nclustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a\nwide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular\ndiseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal\nvessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the\nquantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature\ndiffers significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it\nconsists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology\nvaries greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges\nto segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose\nMM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel\nsegmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which\nreplace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception\nthrough morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective\nState Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space\nmodeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.\nExtensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in\nsegmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves\nF1-score gains of 1.64 $\\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and advancement.

    "abstract": "Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure\nassessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often\nmissing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission\nissues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and\nrisk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit\nbased spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features\nwith a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and\nseasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with\nlearnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and\namplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive\ndistributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and\ncalibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real\nworld datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing\nagainst five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction\naccuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate\nrobustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of\nextraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep\nlearning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in\nemerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.",

This paper\nintroduces ScenicProver, a verification framework that aims to fill this gap.\nBuilt upon the Scenic probabilistic programming language, the framework\nsupports: (1) compositional system description with clear component interfaces,\nranging from interpretable code to black boxes; (2) assume-guarantee contracts\nover those components using an extension of Linear Temporal Logic containing\narbitrary Scenic expressions; (3) evidence generation through testing, formal\nproofs via Lean 4 integration, and importing external assumptions; (4)\nsystematic combination of generated evidence using contract operators; and (5)\nautomatic generation of assurance cases tracking the provenance of system-level\nguarantees. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study\non an autonomous vehicle's automatic emergency braking system with sensor\nfusion.

By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively\nmitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious\nsubstructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nbaseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.\nBesides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug\nsynergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the\nmolecular level.

We evaluate\nperformance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,\nROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model\ninterpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations\ndemonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods\nexhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model\ntransferability.

Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in\nMIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as\nsketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning\nprocess. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through\n\"drawing to think\". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically\nchallenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning\nsteps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our\nevaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,\nannotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a\nunified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation\ninput: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with\nimage and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image\nclues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity\non our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under\ndifferent k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large\nlanguage models, including strongest private models as well as strong\nopen-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.\nHowever, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves\nconsistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and\ntasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and\ndesigning textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited\nimprovements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the\ncritical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning\non MIRA.",

    "abstract": "Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action\nin the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks\nsuch as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding\nunderexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG\ncode as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,\nfrontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap\nbetween language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we\nintroduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)\nThinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines\nSVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply\nstructured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic\ncapacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities\nscore well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D\nreasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing\nClaude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on\nrendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual\nrepresentation.

We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D\nheads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder\nfollowed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through\niterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At\nthe heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on\nDINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric\nand appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nnovel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to\nextreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this\nbase model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the\nencoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry\nand style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control\ngeometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.\nWe highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model\nthrough a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt\ngeometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural\nlanguage or image prompts.\n  Project Page: https://antoniooroz.github.io/PercHead Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hFybgTk4kE",

    "abstract": "The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been\nshown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream\ncapabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant\nprogress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of\nvideo data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct\nthe first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing\nthe capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal\nseveral key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly\ndepends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)\nand text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,\nespecially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric\ntest-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable\npredictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the\ncorrelation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and\nnon-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment\nagainst text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and\nunderstanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal\nalignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.\nOverall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot\nway to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal\ndata.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision\nsystems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to\nexplain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works\nsuggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be\nattributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance\npropagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find\nimages that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are\nlargely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered\nconcepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting\nthe accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.\n  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept\nRelevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a\nmultimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive\nnames to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that\ntranslate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To\nensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the\nsemantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and\nexplanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,\noffering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries\nfor non-technical stakeholders.\n  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a\nVGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution\nmethods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to\ninterpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI\nsystems.",

While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion\nanalysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.\nEmotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it\ndifficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable\nrationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided\nreasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression\nanalysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the\ncore of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),\nspecifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These\nmodels undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning\nfor injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement\nlearning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data\ninfrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)\nconsisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes\nexplainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated\nrationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding\ntasks.

While recent high performance models and high quality datasets\nhave significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current\nmodels typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and\ncannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic\nchange detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization\nand limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We\nleverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop\nUniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange\nintegrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.\nOur model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction\nof three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange\nutilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,\neliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows\nUniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even\nwhen their class definitions conflict.

Traditional approaches typically\nrequire extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application\nscenario.

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their\noutput of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for\nprofessional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions\neither rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are\ntraining-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing\nto produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the\nTraining-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a\nnovel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,\nNoise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent\nrepresentations from both foreground and composite generation processes,\ntransplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures\nsemantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite\nlayers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring\nfine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our\ntraining-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,\nenhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and\nfidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but\nalso unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional\nediting, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative\nworkflows.",

By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual\ncortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary\ncognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the\nextraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing\nsubject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike\nconventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and\nheavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\\% accuracy on average yet generates\neach reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast\nand clinically scalable solution.

To address\nthese challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that\nintroduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,\nwe include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and\nview biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale\nstabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to\nreinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for\nmotion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment\n(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical\nTemporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;\nand (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces\ncross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite\nadding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,\nMTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude\nlevels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS\ndatasets.

The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from\n2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently\nannotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from\nacross India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14\nvehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler\n(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,\nHatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k\nconsensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct\nobjects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,\nwe train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,\nand DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,\nmAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in\nmAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with\nRT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40\nfor COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This\ndemonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic\nscenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus\nannotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the\n6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the\nheterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera\nstreams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and\noffers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of\nintelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic\nconditions.",

Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected\nautoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature\nmatching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled\ndataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect\npatterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under\nboth ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were\ndefined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one\nadditionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter\nsimulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced\nfringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated\nin terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial\ndefect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves\nsuperior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared\nto the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of\nfeature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings.

Traditionally, this process has been\nmanually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video\nediting technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often\nfail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly. To\naddress this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for\nvideo shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching\nbetween the script generated by a large language model and a video library to\nobtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we\nsegment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such\nas shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models\nto learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their\nalignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization\nby combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the\nassembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the\narrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,\nnarrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style\nof reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual\nexpression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience\ncan create visually compelling videos. Project page:\nhttps://sobeymil.github.io/esa.com",

    "abstract": "The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where\nfoundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\nshow great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for\nspecialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation\nstrategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new\nmulti-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this\nbenchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies\non a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter\nrecommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that\nthe optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT\nand ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by\ncontext-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of\n0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the\nsuperior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a\npowerful \"super-expert\" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm\nthe superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual\ninterference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked\nagainst strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer\nkey observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our\nbenchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for\ndeveloping more effective science-based agentic systems.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial\nfor measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,\nsatellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents\na cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object\ndetection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,\nheterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual\nlocalization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are\nextracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is\nestimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because\npublicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches\nrecast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these\ndatasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain\ndifferences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,\nor generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,\ncontent loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object\ndetection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite\nimages, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and\nintra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based\nnode-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization\nperformance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that\nour approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and\ngeneralizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,\nsuch as infrared-visible image matching.

To address this gap, OLATverse\noffers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real\nobjects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.\nSpecifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,\nspanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35\nDSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the\nsimulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we\nprovide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric\nsurface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct\nan extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world\nobject-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation.

    "abstract": "Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple\ncamera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this\ntask, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by\ncombining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising\ncooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods\nfocus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire\nvideo, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action\nrecognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized\nsequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action\nrecognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we\nintroduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast\nto previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial\ninformation, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in\nthe STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our\nmodule, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model\nthe relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments\nusing a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the\ncomparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.",

    "abstract": "Mobile eye tracking plays a vital role in capturing human visual attention\nacross both real-world and extended reality (XR) environments, making it an\nessential tool for applications ranging from behavioural research to\nhuman-computer interaction. However, missing values due to blinks, pupil\ndetection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for\nfurther gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a\nmulti-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the\nfirst time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the\ninherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a\ntransformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye\nand head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional\nbody movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D,\nand HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms\nconventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series\nimputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses\nconfirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match\nactual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations.\nMoreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable\ndevices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture\nin the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our\nmethod paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in\nreal-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based\nanalysis and interaction across various application domains.",

While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance\ncomponent, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data\naugmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while\npreserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation\nacross lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness\nenhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure\ncorrection demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over\nexisting methods.",

This\nheterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the\ngeneralizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We\npresent MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias\nquantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection,\nimage processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies\nmetadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive\nreview of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography\ndatasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to\nthree heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify\nsubstantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence.\nCritically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models\ntrained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation\ncompared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and\nmitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training\ncorpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain\ngeneralization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for\nbias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and\nadvancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across\ndiverse patient populations and clinical settings.

    "abstract": "Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet\nimportant task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most\nprevious color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.\nThe purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color\ncorrection algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating\nthe overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and\nthen adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close\nproximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,\nnamely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated\noverlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target\npoints in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method\nis proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the\nhistogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a\nhistogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,\nwe discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our\nalgorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm\nhas been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

While the segmentation of\ncamera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often\nintroduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal\nsequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this\nproblem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler\nvelocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.\nHowever, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation\nfor use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and\ncost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of\nself-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point\nclouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised\nrepresentation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited\namounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss\nfunction with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain\nthe network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data.

We introduce a strategy termed \"BBox and Index as\nVisual Prompt\" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,\nMolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the\ninput image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language\ndescription problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy\nsignificantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model\ndesign. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude\nlarger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset\nacross four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.

    "abstract": "In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and\nbeyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world\nin multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain\nconstrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic\ntokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual\nperception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous\nVision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that\nleverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.\nThe core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent\nQ-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a\nchain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this\nprocess, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual\nregions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain\ngrounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines\ncontrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment\nbetween latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.\nEvaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong\nbaselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B\nmodels on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that\nlearned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,\nhighlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between\ndiscrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.",

    "abstract": "We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework\nthat enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited\nby outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring\nsound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to\noverthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL\naddresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,\nwhich evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,\nand answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines\nwhether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the\nstate-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal\nunderstanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive\nperformance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and\nsubstantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework\nfor building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/BytedanceDouyinContent/SAIL-RL.",

However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy\ncamera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of\ndepth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain\nadaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the\nstyle of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated\nimages with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains\nbetween real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a\nlatent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by\nreducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central\nairway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on\nthe depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated\nsynthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent\ndomain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature\nconsistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway\nphantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps.

Recent studies on\nmultimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising\nresults by integrating multi-scale complementary features.

In\naddition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead\nto biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and\nConsistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis.

To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is\ndegraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy.

For system matrix\nrecovery on the Open MPI dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08\ndB, and SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling, and maintained strong performance even at\nchallenging scale 8x (pSNR = 31.06 dB, SSIM = 0.717).

On average, it reduced nRMSE\nby 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, and improved SSIM by 34.3% over\ninterpolation and CNN-based methods.

Our\nevaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a\nmean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.\n  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation\nwith our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean\ndifference (95\\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).\nIncorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of\nthe models in quantifying abnormal deformation.

Plant phenotyping plays\na vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits\nsuch as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional\nplant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often\ndestructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful\nframeworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of\nmulti-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable\nnon-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their\npromise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct\nthe entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,\nincreases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction\nframework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment\nAnything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean\nstrawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate\ngeometric representations while substantially reducing computational time.

The\nGVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over\nvideo content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the\nreferenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed\napproach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video\nReasoning \\& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key\ncontribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed\nCORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object\nto serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve\nthe HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the\nprevious year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.",

This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism\nfor tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a\nwide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on\nadditional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages\nthe event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional\nNeural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial\nspace and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact.

The results demonstrated significant improvements:\nenhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased\npercentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,\nwhich serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,\ndecreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in\nlow-light conditions.

    "abstract": "Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in\nassessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,\nachieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due\nto: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits\nthe efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid\nmeasurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate\ncomprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,\nthis study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from\ndigital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)\ninitial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a\nbinary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for\nquasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation\nAxis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA.

In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates\ninstance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in\nforaminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically\nreconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed\ntomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple\ninstance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of\nthe chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order\nreconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort\nwhile maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation\nmodels exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel\nfidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm\nremains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental\ntrajectories even under partial segmentation.

We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to\nquantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.\nGRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without\naccess to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an\ninformation-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of\ngradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the\ndistilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%\nSpearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo\nstudents. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher\ncan improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the\nbest-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design\nchoices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when\ngenerating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size\nconstraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.\nAltogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively\nidentify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide\nfine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.",

While several carefully\ndesigned long-context evaluations have recently been released, these\nevaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,\nwhich allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This\nrepresents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We\nintroduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require\nanalyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating\nthese analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two\ntask sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can\neasily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a\ndownstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational\ndata. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to\nperform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over\ntemporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with\nGPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy\non both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong\nto enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities\nof text.",

    "abstract": "Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM\ncontext, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,\nresulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the\ncurrent turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This\ntrade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,\nwe propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact\nmemory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses\nthe user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform\nsearch actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for\nsolving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn\ninteractions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize\nthis workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that\njointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of\nMemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of\ntrajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level\nadvantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as\nSearch-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines\non seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains.

Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks\nsuch as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding\nunderexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG\ncode as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,\nfrontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap\nbetween language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we\nintroduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)\nThinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines\nSVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply\nstructured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic\ncapacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities\nscore well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D\nreasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing\nClaude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on\nrendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual\nrepresentation.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains\nand come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM\nsystems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches\npredominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for\nevery input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In\nthis work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller\nLLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and\ncost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as\nreinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while\nminimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent\nsystem to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during\ninference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework\nthat optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget\nsetting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a\nsingle system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while\nmaintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and\ncost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.",

The success of these systems will\ncritically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,\neven under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical\nstudies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a\ncollaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative\ncapabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable\nautomated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving\necological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and\nclosed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our\nresults reveal a \"collaboration gap\": models that perform well solo often\ndegrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break\ndown dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well\nalone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting\nwith the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a \"relay inference\"\napproach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,\nclosing much of the gap.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse\napplications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language\nmodels (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when\ntested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations.\nHowever, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific\nmanifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work\naddresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and\nconducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task\ntypes, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning\ntasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge\ntype consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased\nhallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a\nparticular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,\nis a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect\nother knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we\npropose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in\nthe later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced\nhallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge\nreduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing\nexcessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of\nhallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar\ncontexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar\nquestions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge\nlearning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved\nperformance.",

Existing remedies are inadequate:\nlarge-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning\nmethods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise\npolicy updates.

Empirical results show that TRACE\nachieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B,\nGemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B).

While recent high performance models and high quality datasets\nhave significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists.

This constraint leads to poor generalization\nand limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework.

Furthermore, UniChange\nutilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,\neliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in\ntasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to\nthe fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available\ndatasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we\nintroduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k\nhigh-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos\ncovering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data\nare annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding\nboxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications\nsuch as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers\nclear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data\nquality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world\nscenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,\nincluding object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and\nvision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset\nto advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent\nsafety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire\nunderstanding in the AI community.

Using 2,368\neconomics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to\nreplicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds\n(2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human\nexperts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth,\nunemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against\n100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We\nreport two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve\nremarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically\nsignificant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025\ndata demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance\non unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample\nperiod. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting\nadvantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be\nomitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results\nprovide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even\non out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data,\nwhile revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts\ncompared to human panels.",

    "abstract": "While LLMs excel at general tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like\nfinance, requiring diverse skills in domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning,\nand multilingual processing. Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training\n(CPT) \"experts\" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable\nmulti-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\nmodel-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address\nthis gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and\nJapanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,\ncomplementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task\nArithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated\nfrom 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an\nexpert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while\nmerging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain\nskills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is\nhyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also\nsuggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent\nskills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first\nfoundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework\nand providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing\nassets.",

    "abstract": "In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and\nbeyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world\nin multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain\nconstrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic\ntokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual\nperception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous\nVision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that\nleverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.\nThe core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent\nQ-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a\nchain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this\nprocess, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual\nregions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain\ngrounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines\ncontrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment\nbetween latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.\nEvaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong\nbaselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B\nmodels on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that\nlearned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,\nhighlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between\ndiscrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.",

Current studies have\nproposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation\nfor embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by\nleveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly\ntrained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,\nshowing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial\nembedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for\nsome queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal\nenvironments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal\nmultimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

In order to\nunderstand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as\nexpected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries\nto probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple\nLLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples\nthe space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to\ncreate realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our\nevaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using\nLLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge\ntreatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies\non inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation\nLLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's\nKappa $\\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs\nyield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and\nraces. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as\nevaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but\nnon-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data.

Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are\ncritical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall\npredictive performance.

We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to\nquantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.\nGRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without\naccess to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an\ninformation-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of\ngradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the\ndistilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%\nSpearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo\nstudents. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher\ncan improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the\nbest-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design\nchoices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when\ngenerating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size\nconstraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.\nAltogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively\nidentify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide\nfine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.",

As the\nfoundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to\nsupport new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the\nmodels towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we\nintroduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a\nnew evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;\ngeneralization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to\nsatellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also\ndevelop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its\ncross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation\nmodels for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose\nmodels like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to\nnew satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in\nperformance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,\nthe performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\\% when given\nadditional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the\nlast linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get\nrelatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the\nbenchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the\ndatasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing\nmodels with stronger cross-satellite generalization.",

    "abstract": "Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet,\ndeveloping effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to\nheterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple\nscales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN\nand TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to\ngradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,\ncurrent architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature\nprocessing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with\nquadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component\nprocessing that prevents iterative representation refinement and\ncross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce\nOrion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)\nmulti-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)\nblock-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for\nscalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style\nmemory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across\ndiverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance\nwhile scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new\nstandard for efficient tabular in-context learning.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning\n(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without\ncentralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing\nsensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a\nclient's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can\nlaunch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client\nparticipated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a\nclient's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),\nthereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing\ninputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client\nexposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates\nmost relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat\nvectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)\nadversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted\ncentral server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes\nthat the server has access to a validation/test set with global data\ndistribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds\nshowed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with\n147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in\ngeneral the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be\nefficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10\ndataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy\nimprovement and 33% cumulative privacy.",

In this paper, we\nshow that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by\nits adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.\nMore specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the\nmanifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness\nmeasure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a\ncontinuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We\nfurther demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a\nwell-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,\nSGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\\tr(\\mH)$,\nwhereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\\tr(\\Diag(\\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In\nsolving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this\ndistinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than\nSGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of\nadaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,\nand provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce\nsharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.",

To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE\n(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),\na scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an\nautoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like\nmolecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The\nlatent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property\npredictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the\nlatent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:\n(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on\nSELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable\nformulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with\nlow-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation\nwith limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,\nour approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal\nsmooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional\nexploration and property-aware generation.

    "abstract": "Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air\ncomputation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of\narbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which\nis restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of\ncomputational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication\nsystems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local\ninformation processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp\nis currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous\ndata-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is\nsusceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of\nthe ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with\nmultiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector\nfunction computation but also ensures scalability in the computational\ncomplexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,\nVecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel\nimpairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric\napplications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared\nerror of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel\nconditions.

Experiments across diverse\ncooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency\nand performance of backbone algorithms.

We prove that\nConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO.

An\nagentic, model predictive control (MPC)-based cross-entropy method (CEM)\nplanner operates over short horizons, using prior-mean rollouts within\ndata-driven PRB bounds to maximize a deterministic reward. The model couples\nmulti-scale structured state-space mixtures (MS3M) with a compact stochastic\nlatent to form WM-MS3M, summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs) histories\nand predicting next-step KPIs under hypothetical PRB sequences. On realistic\nO-RAN traces, WM-MS3M cuts mean absolute error (MAE) by 1.69% versus MS3M with\n32% fewer parameters and similar latency, and achieves 35-80% lower root mean\nsquared error (RMSE) than attention/hybrid baselines with 2.3-4.1x faster\ninference, enabling rare-event simulation and offline policy screening.",

    "abstract": "Mislabeled data is a pervasive issue that undermines the performance of\nmachine learning systems in real-world applications. An effective approach to\nmitigate this problem is to detect mislabeled instances and subject them to\nspecial treatment, such as filtering or relabeling. Automatic mislabeling\ndetection methods typically rely on training a base machine learning model and\nthen probing it for each instance to obtain a trust score that each provided\nlabel is genuine or incorrect. The properties of this base model are thus of\nparamount importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of calibrating\nthis model. Our empirical results show that using calibration methods improves\nthe accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, providing a\npractical and effective solution for industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical\ndecision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to\nstop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical\ndecisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense\nthat they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide\nexplicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study\nto date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually\nhelps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we\nperform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on\ninterpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a\nnon-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human\nteachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT\nmodels. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of\nusability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until\nmastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship\nbetween model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:\nteachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research\nis needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use\nKT models.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse\napplications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.",

High inference throughput is\ncritical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under\nhigh request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.\n  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with\nlinear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent\ncomputation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we\nintroduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer\nattention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.\nThese models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained\nreasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing\nless critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.\n  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with\ndifferent SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as\nmore Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant\nof Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,\nachieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the\nproduction-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning\nperformance.

To address these, we propose Federated Attention\n(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention\nmechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and\ncomputational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local\nself-attention over their own token representations while periodically\nexchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer\nblocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private\nprompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual\nrepresentation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across\nprivate data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight\nprovides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated\noptimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this\nframework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within\nparticipants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error\npropagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the\nfundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation\nefficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of\nparticipants.

    "abstract": "We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where\nlearners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously\nobserved that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which\ncharacterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis\n(VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered\nanalogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by\nintroducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the\nconnection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)\nclasses, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the\neffective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,\neven for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for\nvarious notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes\nsatisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that\nCPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that\nrealize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes\nsatisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we\nestablish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by\nconsidering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.",

We\nformalize model exfiltration as a security game, propose a verification\nframework that can provably mitigate steganographic exfiltration, and specify\nthe trust assumptions associated with our scheme. To enable verification, we\ncharacterize valid sources of non-determinism in large language model inference\nand introduce two practical estimators for them. We evaluate our detection\nframework on several open-weight models ranging from 3B to 30B parameters. On\nMOE-Qwen-30B, our detector reduces exfiltratable information to <0.5% with\nfalse-positive rate of 0.01%, corresponding to a >200x slowdown for\nadversaries.

A wide\nrange of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN\ndesign and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available\nfunctionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After\nadopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to\nanother if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are\nintroduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is\nchallenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for\nNNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual\nupdates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure\ncompatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to\nautomatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our\nmethod makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior\nto migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely\nPyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code\nbetween the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.\nExperimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully\nmigrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the\noriginals.

    "abstract": "Associative memory, traditionally modeled by Hopfield networks, enables the\nretrieval of previously stored patterns from partial or noisy cues. Yet, the\nlocal computational principles which are required to enable this function\nremain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information\nprocessing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory\n- Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of\ndifferent inputs to an output into unique information from each input,\nredundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges\nfrom combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons\nin classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the\ninformation in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between\nthe external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and\nunique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and\nperformance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as\nan information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each\nneuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more\nthan tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks\nand even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield\nnetworks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new\ndesign principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new\nassociative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.",

This ensures\nsemantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite\nlayers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring\nfine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our\ntraining-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,\nenhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and\nfidelity.

    "abstract": "Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most\nsuccessful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and\neffectiveness across a range of problems.\n  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and\nbehavior policies to move to the \"right\" direction -- starting from importance\nsampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive\nadvantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function\nis introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio\nin these \"right\" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to\nextend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering\nthe clipping in the \"right\" direction regions. However, due to randomness in\nthe rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the\nratios frequently move to the \"wrong\" direction during the PPO optimization.\nThis is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely\noverlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm\n(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict \"wrong\"\ndirection regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance\nratio falls below (above) $1 - \\beta$ ($1+\\beta$),\n  for a tunable parameter $\\beta \\in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a\nsteeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that\nDClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing\non modifying the objective's behavior in the \"right\" direction, across various\nMuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is\nshown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid \"wrong\" direction\nupdates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint\nthat restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of\nneighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds\nextrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also\napproximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.\nMoreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism\nby adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point.

    "abstract": "Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)\nis a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for\nstudying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most\nexisting approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such\nas conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we\ninvestigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a\nparticipant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically\nmodeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We\nimplement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,\nTime-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).\nPredicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans\nusing metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best\nperforming models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize\nwell to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort\nperformance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict\nparticipant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities\nfor individualized prognosis.",

    "abstract": "We investigate theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) --\nthe fraction of true causal edges whose orientation is not recovered, under\nsingle-variable random interventions and an $\\epsilon$-interventional\nfaithfulness assumption that accommodates latent confounding. For sparse\nErd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales\nas $p_e = \\Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at\nrate $O(\\frac{\\log d}{\\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the\nexpected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This\nconcentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in\nlarge-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\\'asi--Albert\ngraphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies\n$\\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\\beta - \\frac{1}{2}})$ with\n$\\beta = 1/(\\gamma - 1) < \\frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit. This\ndemonstrates that realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize\ncausal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error. These\nfinite-dimension results provide the first dimension-adaptive,\nfaithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery, and challenge the\nintuition that high dimensionality and network heterogeneity necessarily hinder\naccurate discovery. Our simulation results corroborate these theoretical\npredictions, showing that the FNR indeed concentrates and often vanishes in\npractice as dimensionality grows.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to many-vs-many missile guidance using\nvirtual targets (VTs) generated by a Normalizing Flows-based trajectory\npredictor. Rather than assigning n interceptors directly to m physical targets\nthrough conventional weapon target assignment algorithms, we propose a\ncentralized strategy that constructs n VT trajectories representing\nprobabilistic predictions of maneuvering target behavior. Each interceptor is\nguided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse\nflight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal\ninterception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as\nmany-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n > m) by\ndistributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than\npursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across\nvarious target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors)\ndemonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line\nprediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to\n5.8-14.4% when n > m. The results confirm that probabilistic VTs enable\neffective exploitation of numerical superiority, significantly increasing\ninterception probability in many-vs-many scenarios.",

In this paper,\nwe propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP\n(OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning\napproach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we\nreformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various\ndecisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based\nmethods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing\ndecisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism\ndesigned to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental\nresults on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution\nquality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over\nrepresentative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and\nOCLRP.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for\nrepresentation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as\nTransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent\nlimitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.\nIn this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model\nthat challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a\ncompact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear\nSpherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as\na hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments\non three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate\nthat SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean\ncounterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237\nand CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We\nprovide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing\nthat this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to\ncomprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,\nwe prove that the spherical geometry creates an \"inherently hard negative\nsampling\" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the\nmodel to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our\nfindings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an\nimplementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for\ngeometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful\nand stable KGE models.",

This\nheterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the\ngeneralizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We\npresent MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias\nquantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection,\nimage processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies\nmetadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive\nreview of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography\ndatasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to\nthree heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify\nsubstantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence.\nCritically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models\ntrained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation\ncompared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and\nmitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training\ncorpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain\ngeneralization.

While the segmentation of\ncamera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often\nintroduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal\nsequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this\nproblem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler\nvelocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.\nHowever, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation\nfor use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and\ncost-intensive.

We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss\nfunction with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain\nthe network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data.

While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical\nstandard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently\nsubjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to\nautomate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and\nefficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network\narchitectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal\npatterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current\nmodels often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially\nwhen dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in\nbiomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM\narchitecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound\nrecordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the\nH-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.\nExtensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a\npublic benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed\nmodel achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a\ntest accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.",

Current studies have\nproposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation\nfor embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by\nleveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly\ntrained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,\nshowing effective results.

Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal\nenvironments.

Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

To enable this autonomous evolution, we\ndesign a closed-loop \"attack-evaluate-distill-reuse\" core mechanism that not\nonly generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes\nreusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate\nand apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library\nthat categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on\ntheir performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise\nguidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and\ntransferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting,\nand the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR)\nof 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.",

This paper proposes a novel Evolving\nGraph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware\ninvariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment\nsequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer\nthe underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for\nenvironment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address\nenvironmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we\nconduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture\nof instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish\nspatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in\nnon-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority\nof EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution\nshifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the\ndynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution\nperspective.",

    "abstract": "Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling\nefficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target\ndistributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often\nsufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has\nexplored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as\ncomponents of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical\nstudies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling\nefficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt\ntheir architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC\nsimilarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or\nsuperior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose\na factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by\ncombining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to\ntarget geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are\napproximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional\nNF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail\nsamples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better\nperformance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood\nand prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on\nhierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel\ngeometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian\nmodel analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and\nsoftware strides in neural MCMC design.",

The\nmodel is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization\nstrategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and\nintra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task\nembeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's\ngeneralization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance\nwithin each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general\nintrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on\nthree domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five\ndiverse domains.

A synchronous multi-process worker\nsystem interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and\naccelerated data collection.

Building on the seminal work\nof Saad and Solla, which analyzed the deterministic (ballistic) scaling limits\nof SGD corresponding to the gradient flow of the population loss, we focus on\nthe critical scaling regime of the step size. Below this critical scale, the\neffective dynamics are governed by ballistic (ODE) limits, but at the critical\nscale, new correction term appears that changes the phase diagram. In this\nregime, near the fixed points, the corresponding diffusive (SDE) limits of the\neffective dynamics reduces to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process under certain\nconditions.

This coarse-grained resource management\nleads to degraded performance or significant resource underutilization due to\npoor adaptability to dynamic inference traffic that is common online.\n  The root cause of this inefficiency lies in the internal structure of\ngenerative models: they are executed as graphs of interconnected operators.\nThrough detailed characterization and systematic analysis, we find that\noperators are heterogeneous in their compute and memory footprints and exhibit\ndiverse sensitivity to workload and resource factors such as batch size,\nsequence length, and traffic rate. This heterogeneity suggests that the\noperator, rather than the entire model, is the right granularity for scaling\ndecisions.\n  We propose an operator-level autoscaling framework, which allocates resources\nat finer (operator)-granularity, optimizing the scaling, batching, and\nplacement based on individual operator profiles. Evaluated on production-scale\ntraces, our approach preserves SLOs with up to 40% fewer GPUs and 35% less\nenergy, or under fixed resources achieves 1.6x higher throughput with 5% less\nenergy.

In order to\nunderstand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as\nexpected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries\nto probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple\nLLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples\nthe space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to\ncreate realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our\nevaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using\nLLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge\ntreatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies\non inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation\nLLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's\nKappa $\\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs\nyield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and\nraces.

    "abstract": "Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible\nlearning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the\nStructurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel\ncomputational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the\nmorphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates\non a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local\nprediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning\nmechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the\ntemporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned\nexpectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically\nmigrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This\ndual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information\n(synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources\n(network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole\nreinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture\ncan successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The\nnetwork's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis\nwas sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while\ncontinual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after\nachieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes\npost-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks\nmaintained an average 82% success rate.",

The experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%\nreduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to\ntraditional methods.

    "abstract": "Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure\nassessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often\nmissing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission\nissues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and\nrisk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit\nbased spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features\nwith a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and\nseasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with\nlearnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and\namplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive\ndistributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and\ncalibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real\nworld datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing\nagainst five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction\naccuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate\nrobustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of\nextraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep\nlearning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in\nemerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.",

However, the\nconventional bulk synchronous parallel~(BSP) model used in such settings\nintroduces significant performance inefficiencies. To characterize these\nbottlenecks, we introduce the ''Three Taxes'' (Bulk Synchronous, Inter-Kernel\nData Locality, and Kernel Launch Overhead) as an analytical framework. We\npropose moving beyond the rigid BSP model to address key inefficiencies in\ndistributed GPU execution. By exploiting libraries like Iris for Triton, we\ngain access to in-kernel communication primitives that enable the design of\nnovel fine-grained programming patterns, offering greater flexibility and\nperformance than traditional BSP-based approaches. These patterns\nsystematically eliminate the three taxes by creating direct, tile-level\nproducer-consumer pipelines and replacing global barriers with fine-grained\ndataflow synchronization. Applying this methodology to critical kernels, from\nthe foundational All-Gather + general matrix multiplication operation to the\ncomplex Flash Decode algorithm, we observe a 10-20% speedup in end-to-end\nlatency over BSP-based approaches, establishing a more programmable and\nefficient paradigm for distributed LLM workloads.",

This paper\nintroduces ScenicProver, a verification framework that aims to fill this gap.\nBuilt upon the Scenic probabilistic programming language, the framework\nsupports: (1) compositional system description with clear component interfaces,\nranging from interpretable code to black boxes; (2) assume-guarantee contracts\nover those components using an extension of Linear Temporal Logic containing\narbitrary Scenic expressions; (3) evidence generation through testing, formal\nproofs via Lean 4 integration, and importing external assumptions; (4)\nsystematic combination of generated evidence using contract operators; and (5)\nautomatic generation of assurance cases tracking the provenance of system-level\nguarantees. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study\non an autonomous vehicle's automatic emergency braking system with sensor\nfusion.

Current studies have\nproposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation\nfor embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by\nleveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly\ntrained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,\nshowing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial\nembedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for\nsome queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal\nenvironments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal\nmultimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs), as structured knowledge bases that organize\nrelational information across diverse domains, provide a unified semantic\nfoundation for cross-domain recommendation (CDR). By integrating symbolic\nknowledge with user-item interactions, KGs enrich semantic representations,\nsupport reasoning, and enhance model interpretability. Despite this potential,\nexisting KG-based methods still face major challenges in CDR, particularly\nunder non-overlapping user scenarios. These challenges arise from: (C1)\nsensitivity to KG sparsity and popularity bias, (C2) dependence on overlapping\nusers for domain alignment and (C3) lack of explicit disentanglement between\ntransferable and domain-specific knowledge, which limit effective and stable\nknowledge transfer. To this end, we propose KGBridge, a knowledge-guided prompt\nlearning framework for cross-domain sequential recommendation under\nnon-overlapping user scenarios. KGBridge comprises two core components: a\nKG-enhanced Prompt Encoder, which models relation-level semantics as soft\nprompts to provide structured and dynamic priors for user sequence modeling\n(addressing C1), and a Two-stage Training Paradigm, which combines cross-domain\npretraining and privacy-preserving fine-tuning to enable knowledge transfer\nwithout user overlap (addressing C2). By combining relation-aware semantic\ncontrol with correspondence-driven disentanglement, KGBridge explicitly\nseparates and balances domain-shared and domain-specific semantics, thereby\nmaintaining complementarity and stabilizing adaptation during fine-tuning\n(addressing C3). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nKGBridge consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and remains robust\nunder varying KG sparsity, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating\nstructural imbalance and semantic entanglement in KG-enhanced cross-domain\nrecommendation.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in large-scale robotic datasets and vision-language models\n(VLMs) has advanced research on vision-language-action (VLA) models. However,\nexisting VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing\nprecise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging\ndomain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot\nembodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent\nvariables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy\nlearning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal\nknowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we\npresent X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable\nVLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces\nthe \\emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation\nlearned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and\nrobotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an\nintermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii)\naligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to\ncapture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a\nthree-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii)\nUVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and\n(iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive\nreal-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot\nembodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\\pi_{0.5}$, $\\pi_0$, RDT,\nUniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel\nobjects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.

Rather than assigning n interceptors directly to m physical targets\nthrough conventional weapon target assignment algorithms, we propose a\ncentralized strategy that constructs n VT trajectories representing\nprobabilistic predictions of maneuvering target behavior. Each interceptor is\nguided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse\nflight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal\ninterception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as\nmany-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n > m) by\ndistributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than\npursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across\nvarious target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors)\ndemonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line\nprediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to\n5.8-14.4% when n > m. The results confirm that probabilistic VTs enable\neffective exploitation of numerical superiority, significantly increasing\ninterception probability in many-vs-many scenarios.",

This limits their robust performance with irregular objects and in\ncomplex, unstructured environments. Inspired by the adaptive structure and\nhigh-performance sensory capabilities of cephalopod suckers, in this paper, we\npropose a novel, intelligent sucker, named SuckTac, that integrates a\ncamera-based tactile sensor directly within its optimized structure to provide\nhigh-density perception and robust suction. Specifically, through joint\nstructure design and optimization and based on a multi-material integrated\ncasting technique, a camera and light source are embedded into the sucker,\nwhich enables in-situ, high-density perception of fine details like surface\nshape, texture and roughness. To further enhance robustness and adaptability,\nthe sucker's mechanical design is also optimized by refining its profile,\nadding a compliant lip, and incorporating surface microstructure.

    "abstract": "Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies\non large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However,\nthis one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper\ncontextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their\nbehavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to\nlanguage (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent\ncapable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal\nrepresentations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We\nintroduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such\nbidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly\ntrained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from\nlanguage (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying\nsemantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a\nself-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data\nthrough an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby\nimproving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on\npick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY\nimproves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust\nlanguage-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

Using\nPyElastica and the OpenAI Gym interface, we train both a global Proximal Policy\nOptimisation (PPO) controller and a Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) under identical\nbudgets. Both approaches are based on the arm having $n$ number of controlled\nsections. The study systematically varies $n$ and evaluates the performance of\nthe arm to reach a fixed target in three scenarios: default baseline condition,\nrecovery from external disturbance, and adaptation to actuator failure.\nQuantitative metrics used for the evaluation are mean action magnitude, mean\nfinal distance, mean episode length, and success rate. The results show that\nthere are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of\ncontrolled sections $n\\le4$. In very simple systems, when $n\\le2$, the\ncentralised policy outperforms the distributed one. When $n$ increases to $4<\nn\\le 12$, the distributed policy shows a high sample efficiency. In these\nsystems, distributed policy promotes a stronger success rate, resilience, and\nrobustness under local observability and yields faster convergence given the\nsame sample size. However, centralised policies achieve much higher time\nefficiency during training as it takes much less time to train the same size of\nsamples. These findings highlight the trade-offs between centralised and\ndistributed policy in reinforcement learning-based control for soft robotic\nsystems and provide actionable design guidance for future sim-to-real transfer\nin soft rod-like manipulators.",

    "abstract": "Collaborating teams of robots show promise due in their ability to complete\nmissions more efficiently and with improved robustness, attributes that are\nparticularly useful for systems operating in marine environments. A key issue\nis how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the\nfull benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of\nmulti-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This\npaper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the\nprinciple of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for\ncollective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior\noptimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component\nis expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective\nbehavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model\ncan be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization\nand control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors\nthat are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new\nmethod for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where\nrobots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost\nfunctions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states\nfrom neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group\ncan collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the\ntotal global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in\nthree categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface\nvehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario,\nand a competitive game of capture the flag.",

This robust\nformulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains\nstable under more general settings.

This distinction is critical for AI\nalignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human\nintentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in\npreference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,\npresenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,\ninformal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a\nmodel's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of\ngeneralizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.\nAcross 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize\ndeep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than\nsmaller models.

While the\nperformance of recent LLMs is generally outstanding, several studies have shown\nthat they can often produce incorrect results. Automatically identifying these\nfaulty behaviors is extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of LLMs.\nOne obstacle to this is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which\nnecessitates an oracle to determine the correctness of LLM behaviors.\nMetamorphic testing (MT) is a popular testing approach that alleviates this\noracle problem. At the core of MT are metamorphic relations (MRs), which define\nrelationships between the outputs of related inputs. MT can expose faulty\nbehaviors without the need for explicit oracles (e.g., labeled datasets). This\npaper presents the most comprehensive study of MT for LLMs to date. We\nconducted a literature review and collected 191 MRs for NLP tasks. We\nimplemented a representative subset (36 MRs) to conduct a series of experiments\nwith three popular LLMs, running approximately 560,000 metamorphic tests. The\nresults shed light on the capabilities and opportunities of MT for LLMs, as\nwell as its limitations.",

    "abstract": "Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for\nassigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in\ndataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure\nthat requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,\nmaking it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric\nalternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each\ndatapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how\nmuch it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective\ndimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the\ndummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending\nthem to \\emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains\nthat connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We\nfurther show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose\nparameters and predictive risk are within $O(\\varepsilon)$ of the full-data\noptimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and\ndownstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment\nin which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms\nstandard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and\noperation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary\nbehavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and\nmachine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to\nmaintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.\nOnline learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has\nbeen largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an\napplication of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream\nfor prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion\nfacility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain\nML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.\nMoreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance\ndegradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As\nsuch, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further\nimprove the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)\ntechnique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the\nuncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces\npredictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of\nhistorical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the\npredictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed\nuncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and\n10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.",

Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd\nTracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)\ndepth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)\nglobal and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by\ncomparing \"skin-to-bone\" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot\nmodels, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target\ntrials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap\nharvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per\ntrial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced\nand CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,\n1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by\nanatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm\ncoverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed\nsignificantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,\nmarkerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,\nand lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical\nclinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization\nplus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or\nlow-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR\nguidance.",

To\naddress this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a\nPrithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using\nPlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2.

In terms of computational\ntime, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),\nmaking it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).\nContrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate\nimprovements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling\neffort compared to traditional U-Net.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a robust framework for\nenhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. Recent advances\nin RAG have investigated graph based retrieval for intricate reasoning;\nhowever, the influence of prompt design on enhancing the retrieval and\nreasoning process is still considerably under-examined. In this paper, we\npresent a prompt-driven GraphRAG framework that underscores the significance of\nprompt formulation in facilitating entity extraction, fact selection, and\npassage reranking for multi-hop question answering. Our approach creates a\nsymbolic knowledge graph from text data by encoding entities and factual\nrelationships as structured facts triples. We use LLMs selectively during\nonline retrieval to perform semantic filtering and answer generation. We also\nuse entity-guided graph traversal through Personalized PageRank (PPR) to\nsupport efficient, scalable retrieval based on the knowledge graph we built.\nOur system gets state-of-the-art performance on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA,\nwith F1 scores of 80.7% and 78.9%, and Recall@5 scores of 97.1% and 98.1%,\nrespectively. These results show that prompt design is an important part of\nimproving retrieval accuracy and response quality.

Real stochastic processes\nexhibit a degree of memory effects (correlations in time), long-range\ndependencies, roughness and anomalous diffusion phenomena that are not captured\nin standard diffusion or bridge modeling due to the use of Brownian motion\n(BM). As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation of fBM (MA-fBM),\nwe construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the\nnon-Markovian nature of fBM. We prove the existence of a coupling-preserving\ngenerative diffusion bridge and leverage it for future state prediction from\npaired training data. We then extend our formulation to the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nbridge problem and derive a principled loss function to learn the unpaired data\ntranslation. We evaluate FDBM on both tasks: predicting future protein\nconformations from aligned data, and unpaired image translation. In both\nsettings, FDBM achieves superior performance compared to the Brownian\nbaselines, yielding lower root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of C$_\\alpha$\natomic positions in protein structure prediction and lower Fr\\'echet Inception\nDistance (FID) in unpaired image translation.",

In this paper, we\npresent a unified autonomous driving model, UniLION, which efficiently handles\nlarge-scale LiDAR point clouds, high-resolution multi-view images, and even\ntemporal sequences based on the linear group RNN operator (i.e., performs\nlinear RNN for grouped features). Remarkably, UniLION serves as a single\nversatile architecture that can seamlessly support multiple specialized\nvariants (i.e., LiDAR-only, temporal LiDAR, multi-modal, and multi-modal\ntemporal fusion configurations) without requiring explicit temporal or\nmulti-modal fusion modules. Moreover, UniLION consistently delivers competitive\nand even state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of core tasks,\nincluding 3D perception (e.g., 3D object detection, 3D object tracking, 3D\noccupancy prediction, BEV map segmentation), prediction (e.g., motion\nprediction), and planning (e.g., end-to-end planning). This unified paradigm\nnaturally simplifies the design of multi-modal and multi-task autonomous\ndriving systems while maintaining superior performance.

    "abstract": "2D-to-3D human pose lifting is a fundamental challenge for 3D human pose\nestimation in monocular video, where graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and\nattention mechanisms have proven to be inherently suitable for encoding the\nspatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joints. However, depth ambiguity and\nerrors in 2D pose estimation lead to incoherence in the 3D trajectory. Previous\nstudies have attempted to restrict jitters in the time domain, for instance, by\nconstraining the differences between adjacent frames while neglecting the\nglobal spatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joint motion. To tackle this\nproblem, we design HGFreNet, a novel GraphFormer architecture with hop-hybrid\nfeature aggregation and 3D trajectory consistency in the frequency domain.\nSpecifically, we propose a hop-hybrid graph attention (HGA) module and a\nTransformer encoder to model global joint spatial-temporal correlations. The\nHGA module groups all $k$-hop neighbors of a skeletal joint into a hybrid group\nto enlarge the receptive field and applies the attention mechanism to discover\nthe latent correlations of these groups globally. We then exploit global\ntemporal correlations by constraining trajectory consistency in the frequency\ndomain. To provide 3D information for depth inference across frames and\nmaintain coherence over time, a preliminary network is applied to estimate the\n3D pose. Extensive experiments were conducted on two standard benchmark\ndatasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. The results demonstrate that the proposed\nHGFreNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of positional\naccuracy and temporal consistency.",

Most existing research centers on adversarial robustness (AR),\nwhich evaluates models under worst-case scenarios by examining the existence of\ndeterministic adversarial examples (AEs). In contrast, probabilistic robustness\n(PR) adopts a statistical perspective, measuring the probability that\npredictions remain correct under stochastic perturbations. While PR is widely\nregarded as a practical complement to AR, dedicated training methods for\nimproving PR are still relatively underexplored, albeit with emerging progress.\nAmong the few PR-targeted training methods, we identify three limitations: i\nnon-comparable evaluation protocols; ii limited comparisons to strong AT\nbaselines despite anecdotal PR gains from AT; and iii no unified framework to\ncompare the generalization of these methods. Thus, we introduce PRBench, the\nfirst benchmark dedicated to evaluating improvements in PR achieved by\ndifferent robustness training methods. PRBench empirically compares most common\nAT and PR-targeted training methods using a comprehensive set of metrics,\nincluding clean accuracy, PR and AR performance, training efficiency, and\ngeneralization error (GE). We also provide theoretical analysis on the GE of PR\nperformance across different training methods. Main findings revealed by\nPRBench include: AT methods are more versatile than PR-targeted training\nmethods in terms of improving both AR and PR performance across diverse\nhyperparameter settings, while PR-targeted training methods consistently yield\nlower GE and higher clean accuracy.

    "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models aim to understand natural language\ninstructions and visual observations and to execute corresponding actions as an\nembodied agent. Recent work integrates future images into the\nunderstanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand,\ngenerate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and\nactions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality\nunification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate\nprocesses, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our\ncore philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a\nsynchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions\nto evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance.\nWe ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint\nDiscrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process\nthat integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve\nas the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be\nintrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified\ntokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further\npropose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques\nthat optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and\nSimplerEnv with 4$\\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we\ndemonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world\nevaluations.

    "abstract": "Compared to hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC) not\nonly maintains the structural features of tissue samples, but also provides\nhigh-resolution protein localization, which is essential for aiding in\npathology diagnosis. Despite its diagnostic value, IHC remains a costly and\nlabor-intensive technique. Its limited scalability and constraints in\nmultiplexing further hinder widespread adoption, especially in resource-limited\nsettings. Consequently, researchers are increasingly exploring computational\nstain translation techniques to synthesize IHC-equivalent images from\nH&E-stained slides, aiming to extract protein-level information more\nefficiently and cost-effectively. However, most existing stain translation\ntechniques rely on a linearly weighted summation of multiple loss terms within\na single objective function, strategy that often overlooks the interdepedence\namong these components-resulting in suboptimal image quality and an inability\nto simultaneously preserve structural authenticity and color fidelity. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a novel network architecture that follows a\nprogressive structure, incorporating color and cell border generation logic,\nwhich enables each visual aspect to be optimized in a stage-wise and decoupled\nmanner. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed network architecture, we\nbuild upon the Adaptive Supervised PatchNCE (ASP) framework as our baseline. We\nintroduce additional loss functions based on 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB)\nchromogen concentration and image gradient, enhancing color fidelity and cell\nboundary clarity in the generated IHC images. By reconstructing the generation\npipeline using our structure-color-cell boundary progressive mechanism,\nexperiments on HER2 and ER datasets demonstrated that the model significantly\nimproved visual quality and achieved finer structural details.",

    "abstract": "Relighting is a crucial task with both practical demand and artistic value,\nand recent diffusion models have shown strong potential by enabling rich and\ncontrollable lighting effects. However, as they are typically optimized in\nsemantic latent space, where proximity does not guarantee physical correctness\nin visual space, they often produce unrealistic results, such as overexposed\nhighlights, misaligned shadows, and incorrect occlusions. We address this with\nUniLumos, a unified relighting framework for both images and videos that brings\nRGB-space geometry feedback into a flow matching backbone. By supervising the\nmodel with depth and normal maps extracted from its outputs, we explicitly\nalign lighting effects with the scene structure, enhancing physical\nplausibility. Nevertheless, this feedback requires high-quality outputs for\nsupervision in visual space, making standard multi-step denoising\ncomputationally expensive. To mitigate this, we employ path consistency\nlearning, allowing supervision to remain effective even under few-step training\nregimes. To enable fine-grained relighting control and supervision, we design a\nstructured six-dimensional annotation protocol capturing core illumination\nattributes. Building upon this, we propose LumosBench, a disentangled\nattribute-level benchmark that evaluates lighting controllability via large\nvision-language models, enabling automatic and interpretable assessment of\nrelighting precision across individual dimensions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that UniLumos achieves state-of-the-art relighting quality with\nsignificantly improved physical consistency, while delivering a 20x speedup for\nboth image and video relighting.

However, directly applying existing\nRL methods to diffusion-based image restoration models is suboptimal, as the\nobjective of restoration fundamentally differs from that of pure generation: it\nplaces greater emphasis on fidelity. In this paper, we investigate how to\neffectively integrate RL into diffusion-based restoration models. First,\nthrough extensive experiments with various reward functions, we find that an\neffective reward can be derived from an Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model,\ninstead of intuitive ground-truth-based supervision, which has already been\noptimized during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Moreover,\nour strategy focuses on using RL for challenging samples that are significantly\ndistant from the ground truth, and our RL approach is innovatively implemented\nusing MLLM-based IQA models to align distributions with high-quality images\ninitially. As the samples approach the ground truth's distribution, RL is\nadaptively combined with SFT for more fine-grained alignment. This dynamic\nprocess is facilitated through an automatic weighting strategy that adjusts\nbased on the relative difficulty of the training samples. Our strategy is\nplug-and-play that can be seamlessly applied to diffusion-based restoration\nmodels, boosting its performance across various restoration tasks.

    "abstract": "In the retrieval domain, candidates' fusion from heterogeneous retrievers is\na long-standing challenge, particularly for complex, multi-modal data such as\nvideos. While typical fusion techniques are training-free, they rely solely on\nrank or score signals, disregarding candidates' representations. This work\nintroduces Vote-in-Context (ViC), a generalized, training-free framework that\nre-thinks list-wise reranking and fusion as a zero-shot reasoning task for a\nVision-Language Model (VLM). The core insight is to serialize both content\nevidence and retriever metadata directly within the VLM's prompt, allowing the\nmodel to adaptively weigh retriever consensus against visual-linguistic\ncontent. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by applying it to the\nchallenging domain of cross-modal video retrieval. To this end, we introduce\nthe S-Grid, a compact serialization map that represents each video as an image\ngrid, optionally paired with subtitles to enable list-wise reasoning over video\ncandidates. ViC is evaluated both as a single-list reranker, where it\ndramatically improves the precision of individual retrievers, and as an\nensemble fuser, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines like\nCombSUM. Across video retrieval benchmarks including ActivityNet and VATEX, the\nframework establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval performance,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex visual and temporal signals\nalongside text. In zero-shot settings, ViC achieves Recall@1 scores of 87.1%\n(t2v) / 89.0% (v2t) on MSR-VTT and 99.6% (v2t) on VATEX, representing massive\ngains of up to +40 Recall@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines. We\npresent ViC as a simple, reproducible, and highly effective recipe for turning\nmodern VLMs into powerful zero-shot rerankers and fusers.

Continuous\ntokenizer (CT) achieves strong performance by bridging multiple\nindependently-trained understanding modules and generation modules, but suffers\nfrom complex multi-stage pipelines and substantial engineering overhead.\nConversely, discrete tokenizers (DT) offer a conceptually elegant idea by\nquantizing each image into a primitive, but inevitably leading to information\nloss and performance degradation. To resolve this tension, we question the\nbinary choice between CT and DT, inspired by the wave-particle duality of\nlight, and propose the Continuous-Discrete Dualistic Visual Tokenizer (CDD-VT).\nWe treat visual data as a flexible composition of image primitives derived from\nquantized codebooks, with the crucial insight that the primitive number\nassigned to each visual sample is adaptively determined according to its\ncomplexity: simple instances use a few primitives, emulating discrete\ntokenization, while complex instances use many, approximating continuous\ntokenization. Two core components are designed: Diverse Quantitative\nPrimitives, which encourage primitives orthogonality to better populate\ninformation space, and Dynamic Primitive Allocator, which assesses sample\ncomplexity to determine the optimal set of primitives.

In this paper, we tailor one Parallel Decoupling Framework (PDF)\nfor multimodal embedding learning, by utilizing the proprietary steerability of\nMLLMs, i.e., their ability to flexibly generate quite differentiated response\nunder explicit instructions. Concretely, PDF conditions a shared MLLM backbone\non distinct, learnable prefixes to roll out multiple parallel paths for one\ninput, then relies on these paths to obtain parallel embeddings. To promote\nfull parallel diversity, we employ Mutual Information Minimization (MIM) as an\nexplicit constraint, coupled with per-path contrastive supervision to maintain\nsemantic alignment. Such dual-objectives force PDF to yield robust semantic\ncoverage and a generalizable embedding space. Ultimately, the remarkable\nembedding space are accessible at inference via one single forward pass,\nincurring negligible computational overhead. We instantiate PDF on multiple\nMLLM backbones and prove its effectiveness on MMEB benchmark. Significant gains\nare consistently achieved across various resolutions and model sizes, e.g.,\nboosting the VLM2Vec-LLaVA-1.6-LR model by a remarkable +8.9% (7B), while the\nVLM2Vec-Qwen2VL models by +4.2% (2B) and +3.1% (7B). In terms of efficiency,\nour 2B model surpasses its baseline by +2.6% using only half the computational\nbudget.",

This distinction is critical for AI\nalignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human\nintentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in\npreference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,\npresenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,\ninformal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a\nmodel's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of\ngeneralizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.\nAcross 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize\ndeep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than\nsmaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three\nseparate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of\na core feature of alignment.",

For real finite complex systems formed by\ncountable tokens (animals, words) as instances of distinct types (species,\ndictionary entries), an inverse power-law scaling $S \\sim r^{-\\alpha}$ between\ntype count $S$ and type rank $r$, widely known as Zipf's law, is widely\nobserved to varying degrees of fidelity. A secondary, summary relationship is\nHeaps' law, which states that the number of types scales sublinearly with the\ntotal number of observed tokens present in a growing system. Here, we propose\nan idealized model of a growing system that (1) deterministically produces\narbitrary inverse power-law count rankings for types, and (2) allows us to\ndetermine the exact asymptotics of the type-token relationship. Our argument\nimproves upon and remedies earlier work. We obtain a unified asymptotic\nexpression for all values of $\\alpha$, which corrects the special cases of\n$\\alpha = 1$ and $\\alpha \\gg 1$. Our approach relies solely on the form of\ncount rankings, avoids unnecessary approximations, and does not involve any\nstochastic mechanisms or sampling processes.

    "abstract": "Serving large language models (LLMs) at scale necessitates efficient\nkey-value (KV) cache management. KV caches can be reused across conversation\nturns via shared-prefix prompts that are common in iterative code editing and\nchat. However, stale caches consume scarce GPU memory, require offloading, or\nforce recomputation. We present KVTC, a lightweight transform coder that\ncompresses KV caches for compact on-GPU and off-GPU storage. Drawing on\nclassical media compression, KVTC combines PCA-based feature decorrelation,\nadaptive quantization, and entropy coding. It requires only a brief initial\ncalibration and leaves model parameters unchanged. By exploiting redundancies\nin KV caches, KVTC achieves up to 20$\\times$ compression while maintaining\nreasoning and long-context accuracy, and 40$\\times$ or higher for specific use\ncases. We test KVTC with Llama 3, Mistral NeMo, and R1-Qwen 2.5 models across\nbenchmarks including AIME25, LiveCodeBench, GSM8K, MMLU, Qasper, RULER, and\nMATH-500. It consistently outperforms inference-time baselines such as token\neviction, quantization, and SVD-based methods, while achieving higher\ncompression ratios. These results support KVTC as a practical building block\nfor memory-efficient LLM serving with reusable KV caches.",

    "abstract": "Length control in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial but\nunder-addressed challenge, with applications ranging from voice interfaces\nrequiring concise responses to research summaries needing comprehensive\noutputs. Current approaches to length control, including Regularized DPO,\nLength-Instruction Fine Tuning, and tool-augmented methods, typically require\nexpensive model retraining or complex inference-time tooling. This paper\npresents a prompt engineering methodology that enables precise length control\nwithout model retraining. Our structure-guided approach implements deliberate\nplanning and word counting mechanisms within the prompt, encouraging the model\nto carefully track and adhere to specified length constraints. Comprehensive\nevaluations across six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves length fidelity for several models compared to standard\nprompting when applied to document summarization tasks, particularly for\nshorter-to-medium length constraints. The proposed technique shows varying\nbenefits across different model architectures, with some models demonstrating\nup to 37.6% improvement in length adherence. Quality evaluations further reveal\nthat our approach maintains or enhances overall output quality compared to\nstandard prompting techniques. Our approach provides an immediately deployable\nsolution for applications requiring precise length control, particularly\nvaluable for production environments where model retraining is impractical or\ncost-prohibitive.",

    "abstract": "Language model (LM) assistants are increasingly used in applications such as\nbrainstorming and research. Improvements in memory and context size have\nallowed these models to become more autonomous, which has also resulted in more\ntext accumulation in their context windows without explicit user intervention.\nThis comes with a latent risk: the belief profiles of models -- their\nunderstanding of the world as manifested in their responses or actions -- may\nsilently change as context accumulates. This can lead to subtly inconsistent\nuser experiences, or shifts in behavior that deviate from the original\nalignment of the models. In this paper, we explore how accumulating context by\nengaging in interactions and processing text -- talking and reading -- can\nchange the beliefs of language models, as manifested in their responses and\nbehaviors. Our results reveal that models' belief profiles are highly\nmalleable: GPT-5 exhibits a 54.7% shift in its stated beliefs after 10 rounds\nof discussion about moral dilemmas and queries about safety, while Grok 4 shows\na 27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from the opposing\nposition. We also examine models' behavioral changes by designing tasks that\nrequire tool use, where each tool selection corresponds to an implicit belief.\nWe find that these changes align with stated belief shifts, suggesting that\nbelief shifts will be reflected in actual behavior in agentic systems. Our\nanalysis exposes the hidden risk of belief shift as models undergo extended\nsessions of talking or reading, rendering their opinions and actions\nunreliable.",

SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct initially performs around chance level on\nTextual MNIST, and is capable of learning the task through RIGSA, 4-bit QLoRA\nand random masking. In spite of having more trainable parameters than QLoRA,\nthe RIGSA configurations that we studied displayed less forgetting than QLoRA,\nparticularly on GSM8k, though it performs comparably to random masking.",

    "abstract": "Open-ended generation tasks require outputs to satisfy diverse and often\nimplicit task-specific evaluation rubrics. The sheer number of relevant rubrics\nleads to prohibitively high verification costs and incomplete assessments of a\nresponse, making reinforcement learning (RL) post-training with rubric-based\nrewards difficult to scale. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that often\nthe best way to combine these rubrics into one single reward is also highly\nprompt-specific. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Critic\n(RLAC), a post-training approach that addresses these challenges via dynamic\nrubric verification. Our approach employs a large language model (LLM) as a\ncritic that dynamically identifies only the most likely failure modes (e.g., a\nfactual error or unhandled edge case), which are then verified by an external\nvalidator to optimize both generator and critic jointly. By training both the\ngenerator and the critic, this game enhances the critic's error detection and\nthe generator's output quality while reducing required verifications. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that RLAC improves factual accuracy in text generation\nand correctness in code generation, while also outperforming exhaustive\nverification and reward model methods. We show that dynamic critics are more\neffective than fixed critics, showcasing the potential of RLAC for scaling RL\npost-training to free-form generation tasks.",

Understanding their\ninteraction is key to assessing the grounding of NLEs, yet it remains\nunderexplored. Prior work has largely examined only single-step generation,\ntypically the final answer, and has modelled PK and CK interaction only as a\nbinary choice in a rank-1 subspace. This overlooks richer forms of interaction,\nsuch as complementary or supportive knowledge. We propose a novel rank-2\nprojection subspace that disentangles PK and CK contributions more accurately\nand use it for the first multi-step analysis of knowledge interactions across\nlonger NLE sequences. Experiments on four QA datasets and three open-weight\ninstruction-tuned LLMs show that diverse knowledge interactions are poorly\nrepresented in a rank-1 subspace but are effectively captured in our rank-2\nformulation. Our multi-step analysis reveals that hallucinated NLEs align\nstrongly with the PK direction, context-faithful ones balance PK and CK, and\nChain-of-Thought prompting for NLEs shifts generated NLEs toward CK by reducing\nPK reliance.

The corpora were built in an automatic\nfashion from the ParlaMint transcripts and their corresponding metadata, which\nwere aligned to the speech recordings of each corresponding parliament. In this\nrelease of the dataset, each of the corpora is significantly enriched with\nvarious automatic annotation layers. The textual modality of all four corpora\nhas been enriched with linguistic annotations and sentiment predictions.\nSimilar to that, their spoken modality has been automatically enriched with\noccurrences of filled pauses, the most frequent disfluency in typical speech.\nTwo out of the four languages have been additionally enriched with detailed\nword- and grapheme-level alignments, and the automatic annotation of the\nposition of primary stress in multisyllabic words. With these enrichments, the\nusefulness of the underlying corpora has been drastically increased for\ndownstream research across multiple disciplines, which we showcase through an\nanalysis of acoustic correlates of sentiment.

However, it remains unclear whether\nthese models can effectively capture the detailed spatial information required\nfor robust real-world performance, especially cross-view consistency, a key\nrequirement for accurate 3D reasoning. Considering this issue, we introduce\nViewpoint Learning, a task designed to evaluate and improve the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We present the Viewpoint-100K dataset,\nconsisting of 100K object-centric image pairs with diverse viewpoints and\ncorresponding question-answer pairs. Our approach employs a two-stage\nfine-tuning strategy: first, foundational knowledge is injected to the baseline\nMLLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on Viewpoint-100K, resulting in\nsignificant improvements across multiple tasks; second, generalization is\nenhanced through Reinforcement Learning using the Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) algorithm on a broader set of questions. Additionally, we\nintroduce a hybrid cold-start initialization method designed to simultaneously\nlearn viewpoint representations and maintain coherent reasoning thinking.\nExperimental results show that our approach significantly activates the spatial\nreasoning ability of MLLM, improving performance on both in-domain and\nout-of-domain reasoning tasks. Our findings highlight the value of developing\nfoundational spatial skills in MLLMs, supporting future progress in robotics,\nautonomous systems, and 3D scene understanding.",

This\nproject proposes an interdisciplinary study of linguistic errors produced by\nnative Spanish speakers, with the aim of analyzing how current large language\nmodels (LLM) interpret, reproduce, or correct them. The research integrates\nthree core perspectives: theoretical linguistics, to classify and understand\nthe nature of the errors; neurolinguistics, to contextualize them within\nreal-time language processing in the brain; and natural language processing\n(NLP), to evaluate their interpretation against linguistic errors. A\npurpose-built corpus of authentic errors of native Spanish (+500) will serve as\nthe foundation for empirical analysis. These errors will be tested against AI\nmodels such as GPT or Gemini to assess their interpretative accuracy and their\nability to generalize patterns of human linguistic behavior.

This study employs a\nframework based on behavioural forma mentis networks (i.e. cognitive models\nthat map how individuals structure their associative knowledge and emotional\nperceptions of concepts) to explore individual and group differences in the\nperception and association of concepts related to math and anxiety. We\nconducted 4 experiments involving psychology undergraduates from 2 samples (n1\n= 70, n2 = 57) compared against GPT-simulated students (GPT-3.5: n2 = 300;\nGPT-4o: n4 = 300). Experiments 1, 2, and 3 employ individual-level network\nfeatures to predict psychometric scores for math anxiety and its facets\n(observational, social and evaluational) from the Math Anxiety Scale.\nExperiment 4 focuses on group-level perceptions extracted from human students,\nGPT-3.5 and GPT-4o's networks. Results indicate that, in students, positive\nvalence ratings and higher network degree for \"anxiety\", together with negative\nratings for \"math\", can predict higher total and evaluative math anxiety. In\ncontrast, these models do not work on GPT-based data because of differences in\nsimulated networks and psychometric scores compared to humans. These results\nwere also reconciled with differences found in the ways that high/low subgroups\nof simulated and real students framed semantically and emotionally STEM\nconcepts. High math-anxiety students collectively framed \"anxiety\" in an\nemotionally polarising way, absent in the negative perception of low\nmath-anxiety students. \"Science\" was rated positively, but contrasted against\nthe negative perception of \"math\". These findings underscore the importance of\nunderstanding concept perception and associations in managing students' math\nanxiety.",

BARD uses the thinking budget as a user-specified\ncontrol signal, allowing the model to dynamically balance reasoning performance\nand computational efficiency.

The second phase\nleverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) from a reward signal in consideration of\nreasoning performance and budget fidelity simultaneously. Incorporating the\ntwo-phase regimen is crucial to avoiding policy degradation and ensuring that\nboth objectives are optimized jointly.

This paper introduces a reproducible draft-based\nrefinement pipeline that elevates open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to a\nperformance level statistically comparable to top-tier proprietary systems.

A zero-shot LLM (Llama-3.3 or Qwen3) then polishes\nthis draft, a process that can be further enhanced by augmenting the context\nwith retrieved out-context examples (RAG). We demonstrate the robustness of\nthis approach on two distinct benchmarks: a standard in-domain test set\n(Rosenthal, 2023) and a new, challenging out-of-domain (OOD) set of\n12th-century Latin letters (2025). Our central finding is that this open-source\nRAG system achieves performance statistically comparable to the GPT-5 baseline,\nwithout any task-specific LLM fine-tuning. We release the pipeline, the\nChartres OOD set, and evaluation scripts and models to facilitate replicability\nand further research.",

A genetic\nsearch optimizes a scalar objective that jointly aggregates retrieval metrics\n(recall@k, mAP, nDCG, MRR) and generation metrics (LLM-Judge and semantic\nsimilarity).

RAGSmith finds\nconfigurations that consistently outperform naive RAG baseline by +3.8\\% on\naverage (range +1.2\\% to +6.9\\% across domains), with gains up to +12.5\\% in\nretrieval and +7.5\\% in generation. The search typically explores $\\approx\n0.2\\%$ of the space ($\\sim 100$ candidates) and discovers a robust backbone --\nvector retrieval plus post-generation reflection/revision -- augmented by\ndomain-dependent choices in expansion, reranking, augmentation, and prompt\nreordering; passage compression is never selected.

We argue this conflicting evidence is due to confounding factors in\nexperimental setups, making it hard to compare results and draw conclusions. We\nidentify confounding factors in analyses trying to answer the question of\nwhether, and how, morphology relates to language modeling. Next, we re-assess\nthree hypotheses by Arnett & Bergen (2025) for why modeling agglutinative\nlanguages results in higher perplexities than fusional languages: they look at\nmorphological alignment of tokenization, tokenization efficiency, and dataset\nsize. We show that each conclusion includes confounding factors. Finally, we\nintroduce token bigram metrics as an intrinsic way to predict the difficulty of\ncausal language modeling, and find that they are gradient proxies for\nmorphological complexity that do not require expert annotation. Ultimately, we\noutline necessities to reliably answer whether, and how, morphology relates to\nlanguage modeling.",

While NLI models are trained to\ndetect factual inconsistencies over complete sentences, decisions in the common\nautoregressive generation architecture are made for each evolving text prefix,\nduring decoding. Addressing this setting, we generalize the entailment\ndetection task to apply over arbitrary text prefixes, and suggest its utility\nfor improving generation faithfulness. Providing suitable evaluation and\ntraining datasets for this task, we train MiniTruePrefixes, a novel specialized\nmodel that better detects factual inconsistencies over text prefixes,\noutperforming comparable baseline NLI models by 5-14 F1 points in prefix-level\nentailment. We further demonstrate that integrating MiniTruePrefixes into a\ncontrolled decoding framework substantially improves factual consistency in\nabstractive summarization. When guided by MiniTruePrefixes,\nLLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct matches the faithfulness and runtime of the 8B model from\nthe same model family, while using only half the memory.",

We propose two classes of attacks: (1) static attack,\nwhich employs a fixed injection prompt, and (2) iterative attack, which\noptimizes the injection prompt against a simulated reviewer model to maximize\nits effectiveness. Both attacks achieve striking performance, frequently\ninducing full evaluation scores when targeting frontier AI reviewers.\nFurthermore, we show that these attacks are robust across various settings. To\ncounter this threat, we explore a simple detection-based defense. While it\nsubstantially reduces the attack success rate, we demonstrate that an adaptive\nattacker can partially circumvent this defense. Our findings underscore the\nneed for greater attention and rigorous safeguards against prompt-injection\nthreats in AI-assisted peer review.",

While model-based methods like EAGLE-2 are accurate but costly,\nretrieval-enhanced methods like SAM-Decoding rely on heuristic switching\nstrategies that often trigger unnecessary retrievals. To address this, we\npropose ReSpec (\\textbf{Re}trieval-enhanced \\textbf{Spe}culative Decoding), a\nnovel framework that transforms heuristic drafter switching into adaptive\ndecision-making.

We decompose this position into two orthogonal\ndimensions: \\textit{spatial novelty}, which measures a paper's intellectual\ndistinctiveness from its neighbors, and \\textit{temporal novelty}, which\ncaptures its engagement with a dynamic research frontier. To operationalize\nthese concepts, we leverage Large Language Models to develop semantic isolation\nmetrics that quantify a paper's location relative to the full-text literature.\nApplying this framework to a large corpus of economics articles, we uncover a\nfundamental trade-off: these two dimensions predict systematically different\noutcomes. Temporal novelty primarily predicts citation counts, whereas spatial\nnovelty predicts disruptive impact. This distinction allows us to construct a\ntypology of semantic neighborhoods, identifying four archetypes associated with\ndistinct and predictable impact profiles.

This is a process that naturally\nselects for solutions stable under reframing, thereby avoiding the common trap\nof favoring view-dependent, spurious answers. Crucially, this requires no human\nsupervision or auxiliary models. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks,\nSelf-Harmony achieves state-of-the-art results at the label-free test-time\nsetting, ranking first in 28 of 30 settings across multiple methods.

    "abstract": "In recent years, querying semantic web data using SPARQL has remained\nchallenging, especially for non-expert users, due to the language's complex\nsyntax and the prerequisite of understanding intricate data structures. To\naddress these challenges, we propose InteracSPARQL, an interactive SPARQL query\ngeneration and refinement system that leverages natural language explanations\n(NLEs) to enhance user comprehension and facilitate iterative query refinement.\nInteracSPARQL integrates LLMs with a rule-based approach to first produce\nstructured explanations directly from SPARQL abstract syntax trees (ASTs),\nfollowed by LLM-based linguistic refinements. Users can interactively refine\nqueries through direct feedback or LLM-driven self-refinement, enabling the\ncorrection of ambiguous or incorrect query components in real time. We evaluate\nInteracSPARQL on standard benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in\nquery accuracy, explanation clarity, and overall user satisfaction compared to\nbaseline approaches. Our experiments further highlight the effectiveness of\ncombining rule-based methods with LLM-driven refinements to create more\naccessible and robust SPARQL interfaces.",

For\nthe first time, we introduce efficient data management features that load and\nprocess (filter, select, transform, and combine) retrieval datasets on the fly,\nwith just a few lines of code. This gives users the flexibility to easily\nexperiment with different dataset configurations without the need to compute\nand store multiple copies of large datasets. Trove is highly customizable: in\naddition to many built-in options, it allows users to freely modify existing\ncomponents or replace them entirely with user-defined objects. It also provides\na low-code and unified pipeline for evaluation and hard negative mining, which\nsupports multi-node execution without any code changes. Trove's data management\nfeatures reduce memory consumption by a factor of 2.6. Moreover, Trove's\neasy-to-use inference pipeline incurs no overhead, and inference times decrease\nlinearly with the number of available nodes. Most importantly, we demonstrate\nhow Trove simplifies retrieval experiments and allows for arbitrary\ncustomizations, thus facilitating exploratory research.",

    "abstract": "In the retrieval domain, candidates' fusion from heterogeneous retrievers is\na long-standing challenge, particularly for complex, multi-modal data such as\nvideos. While typical fusion techniques are training-free, they rely solely on\nrank or score signals, disregarding candidates' representations. This work\nintroduces Vote-in-Context (ViC), a generalized, training-free framework that\nre-thinks list-wise reranking and fusion as a zero-shot reasoning task for a\nVision-Language Model (VLM). The core insight is to serialize both content\nevidence and retriever metadata directly within the VLM's prompt, allowing the\nmodel to adaptively weigh retriever consensus against visual-linguistic\ncontent. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by applying it to the\nchallenging domain of cross-modal video retrieval. To this end, we introduce\nthe S-Grid, a compact serialization map that represents each video as an image\ngrid, optionally paired with subtitles to enable list-wise reasoning over video\ncandidates. ViC is evaluated both as a single-list reranker, where it\ndramatically improves the precision of individual retrievers, and as an\nensemble fuser, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines like\nCombSUM. Across video retrieval benchmarks including ActivityNet and VATEX, the\nframework establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval performance,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex visual and temporal signals\nalongside text. In zero-shot settings, ViC achieves Recall@1 scores of 87.1%\n(t2v) / 89.0% (v2t) on MSR-VTT and 99.6% (v2t) on VATEX, representing massive\ngains of up to +40 Recall@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines. We\npresent ViC as a simple, reproducible, and highly effective recipe for turning\nmodern VLMs into powerful zero-shot rerankers and fusers.

    "abstract": "Generative retrieval (GR) has gained significant attention as an effective\nparadigm that integrates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It\ngenerally consists of two stages: constructing discrete semantic identifiers\n(IDs) for documents and retrieving documents by autoregressively generating ID\ntokens. The core challenge in GR is how to construct document IDs (DocIDS) with\nstrong representational power. Good IDs should exhibit two key properties:\nsimilar documents should have more similar IDs, and each document should\nmaintain a distinct and unique ID. However, most existing methods ignore native\ncategory information, which is common and critical in E-commerce. Therefore, we\npropose a novel ID learning method, CAtegory-Tree Integrated Document\nIDentifier (CAT-ID$^2$), incorporating prior category information into the\nsemantic IDs. CAT-ID$^2$ includes three key modules: a Hierarchical Class\nConstraint Loss to integrate category information layer by layer during\nquantization, a Cluster Scale Constraint Loss for uniform ID token\ndistribution, and a Dispersion Loss to improve the distinction of reconstructed\ndocuments. These components enable CAT-ID$^2$ to generate IDs that make similar\ndocuments more alike while preserving the uniqueness of different documents'\nrepresentations. Extensive offline and online experiments confirm the\neffectiveness of our method, with online A/B tests showing a 0.33% increase in\naverage orders per thousand users for ambiguous intent queries and 0.24% for\nlong-tail queries.",

We have trained the network for a classification task\nwhich determines the complexity of an ME. ME complexity has been quantified in\nterms of its nested depth. Based on the nested depth, we have considered three\ncomplexity classes of MEs: Simple, Medium and Complex. After training the\nnetwork, outputs just before the the final fully connected layer are extracted\nfor all the MEs. These outputs form the semantic features of MEs and are stored\nin a database. For a given ME query, its semantic features are computed using\nthe trained DRNN and matched against the semantic feature database. Matching is\nperformed based on the standard euclidean distance and top 'k' nearest matches\nare retrieved, where 'k' is a user-defined parameter.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping numerous facets of our daily\nlives, leading widespread adoption as web-based services. Despite their\nversatility, LLMs face notable challenges, such as generating hallucinated\ncontent and lacking access to up-to-date information. Lately, to address such\nlimitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising\ndirection by generating responses grounded in external knowledge sources. A\ntypical RAG system consists of i) a retriever that probes a group of relevant\npassages from a knowledge base and ii) a generator that formulates a response\nbased on the retrieved content. However, as with other AI systems, recent\nstudies demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG, such as knowledge corruption\nattacks by injecting misleading information. In response, several defense\nstrategies have been proposed, including having LLMs inspect the retrieved\npassages individually or fine-tuning robust retrievers. While effective, such\napproaches often come with substantial computational costs.\n  In this work, we introduce RAGDefender, a resource-efficient defense\nmechanism against knowledge corruption (i.e., by data poisoning) attacks in\npractical RAG deployments. RAGDefender operates during the post-retrieval\nphase, leveraging lightweight machine learning techniques to detect and filter\nout adversarial content without requiring additional model training or\ninference. Our empirical evaluations show that RAGDefender consistently\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses across multiple models and\nadversarial scenarios: e.g., RAGDefender reduces the attack success rate (ASR)\nagainst the Gemini model from 0.89 to as low as 0.02, compared to 0.69 for\nRobustRAG and 0.24 for Discern-and-Answer when adversarial passages outnumber\nlegitimate ones by a factor of four (4x).",

    "abstract": "Reranking algorithms have made progress in improving document retrieval\nquality by efficiently aggregating relevance judgments generated by large\nlanguage models (LLMs). However, identifying relevant documents for queries\nthat require in-depth reasoning remains a major challenge. Reasoning-intensive\nqueries often exhibit multifaceted information needs and nuanced\ninterpretations, rendering document relevance inherently context dependent. To\naddress this, we propose contextual relevance, which we define as the\nprobability that a document is relevant to a given query, marginalized over the\ndistribution of different reranking contexts it may appear in (i.e., the set of\ncandidate documents it is ranked alongside and the order in which the documents\nare presented to a reranking model). While prior works have studied methods to\nmitigate the positional bias LLMs exhibit by accounting for the ordering of\ndocuments, we empirically find that the compositions of these batches also\nplays an important role in reranking performance. To efficiently estimate\ncontextual relevance, we propose TS-SetRank, a sampling-based,\nuncertainty-aware reranking algorithm. Empirically, TS-SetRank improves nDCG@10\nover retrieval and reranking baselines by 15-25% on BRIGHT and 6-21% on BEIR,\nhighlighting the importance of modeling relevance as context-dependent.",

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual\nlearning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when\ntrained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated\nframework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)\ntheory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson\nconfidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple\nmetrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost\nof 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the\nbaseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to\nstate-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers\nare predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of\na critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note\nthat the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the\nsequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The\nframework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical\nguarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core\ncapacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the\nanalysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are\noffered.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to translate high-level instructions\ninto the precise spatial affordances required for robotic manipulation. While\nvisual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods exist, they are often computationally\nintensive. In this work, we introduce TRACE (Textual Reasoning for Affordance\nCoordinate Extraction), a novel methodology that integrates a textual Chain of\nReasoning (CoR) into the affordance prediction process. We use this methodology\nto create the TRACE dataset, a large-scale collection created via an autonomous\npipeline that pairs instructions with explicit textual rationales. By\nfine-tuning a VLM on this data, our model learns to externalize its spatial\nreasoning before acting. Our experiments show that our TRACE-tuned model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 48.1% accuracy on the primary\nWhere2Place (W2P) benchmark (a 9.6% relative improvement) and 55.0% on the more\nchallenging W2P(h) subset. Crucially, an ablation study demonstrates that\nperformance scales directly with the amount of reasoning data used, confirming\nthe CoR's effectiveness. Furthermore, analysis of the model's attention maps\nreveals an interpretable reasoning process where focus shifts dynamically\nacross reasoning steps. This work shows that training VLMs to generate a\ntextual CoR is an effective and robust strategy for enhancing the precision,\nreliability, and interpretability of VLM-based robot control.

To harness this capability,\nwe propose a lightweight actuation-space learning framework that infers\ndistributional control representations for whole-body soft robotic grasping,\ndirectly from deterministic demonstrations using a flow matching model\n(Rectified Flow),without requiring dense sensing or heavy control loops. Using\nonly 30 demonstrations (less than 8% of the reachable workspace), the learned\npolicy achieves a 97.5% grasp success rate across the whole workspace,\ngeneralizes to grasped-object size variations of +-33%, and maintains stable\nperformance when the robot's dynamic response is directly adjusted by scaling\nthe execution time from 20% to 200%.

    "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models aim to understand natural language\ninstructions and visual observations and to execute corresponding actions as an\nembodied agent. Recent work integrates future images into the\nunderstanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand,\ngenerate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and\nactions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality\nunification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate\nprocesses, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our\ncore philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a\nsynchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions\nto evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance.\nWe ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint\nDiscrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process\nthat integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve\nas the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be\nintrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified\ntokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further\npropose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques\nthat optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and\nSimplerEnv with 4$\\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we\ndemonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world\nevaluations.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning of depth and ego-motion, two fundamental 3D perception\ntasks, has made significant strides in recent years. However, most methods\ntreat ego-motion as an auxiliary task, either mixing all motion types or\nexcluding depth-independent rotational motions in supervision. Such designs\nlimit the incorporation of strong geometric constraints, reducing reliability\nand robustness under diverse conditions. This study introduces a discriminative\ntreatment of motion components, leveraging the geometric regularities of their\nrespective rigid flows to benefit both depth and ego-motion estimation. Given\nconsecutive video frames, network outputs first align the optical axes and\nimaging planes of the source and target cameras. Optical flows between frames\nare transformed through these alignments, and deviations are quantified to\nimpose geometric constraints individually on each ego-motion component,\nenabling more targeted refinement. These alignments further reformulate the\njoint learning process into coaxial and coplanar forms, where depth and each\ntranslation component can be mutually derived through closed-form geometric\nrelationships, introducing complementary constraints that improve depth\nrobustness. DiMoDE, a general depth and ego-motion joint learning framework\nincorporating these designs, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple\npublic datasets and a newly collected diverse real-world dataset, particularly\nunder challenging conditions.

While deterministic deep\nnetworks achieve impressive performance under well-constrained conditions, they\nare often overconfident and fail to capture the multi-modality of the\nunderlying pose distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nprobabilistic framework that leverages flow matching on the SE(3) manifold for\nestimating 6D object pose distributions.

Although\nexisting methods have made significant progress, two challenges remain\nunresolved. First, the modality gap between egocentric RGB observations and the\nfloor plan hinders the integration of visual and spatial information for both\nlocal obstacle avoidance and global planning. Second, accurate localization is\ncritical for navigation performance, but remains challenging at deployment in\nunseen environments due to the lack of explicit geometric alignment between RGB\ninputs and floor plans. We propose a novel diffusion-based policy, denoted as\nGlocDiff, which integrates global path planning from the floor plan with local\ndepth-aware features derived from RGB observations. The floor plan offers\nexplicit global guidance, while the depth features provide implicit geometric\ncues, collectively enabling precise prediction of optimal navigation directions\nand robust obstacle avoidance. Moreover, GlocDiff introduces noise perturbation\nduring training to enhance robustness against pose estimation errors, and we\nfind that combining this with a relatively stable VO module during inference\nresults in significantly improved navigation performance. Extensive experiments\non the FloNa benchmark demonstrate GlocDiff's efficiency and effectiveness in\nachieving superior navigation performance, and the success of real-world\ndeployments also highlights its potential for widespread practical\napplications.",

In these adverse conditions, traditional vision\ntechniques struggle to adapt and lead to suboptimal performance. Event-based\ncameras present an attractive solution to this problem, mitigating the issues\nof traditional cameras by tracking changes in the footage on a frame-by-frame\nbasis. In this paper, we introduce a pipeline which can be used to generate\nrealistic synthetic data of an event-based camera mounted to an AUV (Autonomous\nUnderwater Vehicle) in an underwater environment for training vision models. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline using the task of rock detection\nwith poor visibility and suspended particulate matter, but the approach can be\ngeneralized to other underwater tasks.",

Next, wheel\nodometer is integrated through tight coupling, enhanced by nonholonomic\nconstraints (NHC) and vehicle lever arm compensation, to address performance\ndegradation in areas beyond UWB measurement range. Finally, an adaptive motion\nmode switching mechanism dynamically adjusts the robot's motion mode based on\nUWB measurement range and environmental degradation levels.

    "abstract": "Automated parking requires accurate localization for quick and precise\nmaneuvering in tight spaces. While the longitudinal velocity can be measured\nusing wheel encoders, the estimation of the lateral velocity remains a key\nchallenge due to the absence of dedicated sensors in consumer-grade vehicles.\nExisting approaches often rely on simplified vehicle models, such as the\nzero-slip model, which assumes no lateral velocity at the rear axle. It is well\nestablished that this assumption does not hold during low-speed driving and\nresearchers thus introduce additional heuristics to account for differences. In\nthis work, we analyze real-world data from parking scenarios and identify a\nsystematic deviation from the zero-slip assumption.

    "abstract": "The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) does not only serve as the textbook\nmodel for a carnivorous plant, but also has long intrigued both botanists and\nengineers with its rapidly closing leaf trap. The trap closure is triggered by\ntwo consecutive touches of a potential prey, after which the lobes rapidly\nswitch from their concave open-state to their convex close-state and catch the\nprey within 100-500 ms after being triggered. This transformation from concave\nto convex is initiated by changes in turgor pressure and the release of stored\nelastic energy from prestresses in the concave state, which accelerate this\nmovement, leading to inversion of the lobes bi-axial curvature. Possessing two\nlow-energy states, the leaves can be characterized as bistable systems. With\nour research, we seek to deepen the understanding of Venus flytrap motion\nmechanics and apply its principles to the design of an artificial bistable lobe\nactuator. We identified geometrical characteristics, such as dimensional ratios\nand the thickness gradient in the lobe, and transferred these to two 3D-printed\nbistable actuator models. One actuator parallels the simulated geometry of a\nVenus flytrap leaf, the other is a lobe model designed with CAD. Both models\ndisplay concave-convex bi-stability and snap close. These demonstrators are the\nfirst step in the development of an artificial Venus flytrap that mimics the\nmechanical behavior of the biological model and can be used as a soft fast\ngripper.",

Among bioinspired designs, earthworm locomotion has been\nextensively studied for its efficient peristaltic motion, enabling movement in\nconfined and unstructured environments. Existing earthworm-inspired robots\nprimarily utilize pneumatic actuation due to its high force-to-weight ratio and\nease of implementation. However, these systems often rely on bulky,\npower-intensive electronic control units, limiting their practicality. In this\nwork, we present an electronics-free, earthworm-inspired pneumatic robot\nutilizing a modified Pneumatic Logic Gate (PLG) design. By integrating\npreconfigured PLG units with bellow actuators, we achieved a plug-and-play\nstyle modular system capable of peristaltic locomotion without external\nelectronic components. The proposed design reduces system complexity while\nmaintaining efficient actuation. We characterize the bellow actuators under\ndifferent operating conditions and evaluate the robots locomotion performance.\nOur findings demonstrate that the modified PLG-based control system effectively\ngenerates peristaltic wave propagation, achieving autonomous motion with\nminimal deviation. This study serves as a proof of concept for the development\nof electronics-free, peristaltic soft robots.

In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm termed $E^{3}AD$, which\nadvocates for comparative learning between visual feature extraction networks\nand the general EEG large model, in order to learn latent human driving\ncognition for enhancing end-to-end planning. In this work, we collected a\ncognitive dataset for the mentioned contrastive learning process.

Both open-loop and\nclosed-loop tests are conducted for a comprehensive evaluation of planning\nperformance. Experimental results demonstrate that the $E^{3}AD$ paradigm\nsignificantly enhances the end-to-end planning performance of baseline models.\nAblation studies further validate the contribution of driving cognition and the\neffectiveness of comparative learning process. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to integrate human driving cognition for improving\nend-to-end autonomous driving planning.

    "abstract": "Dexterous grasp generation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring\nboth grasp stability and adaptability across diverse objects and tasks.\nAnalytical methods ensure stable grasps but are inefficient and lack task\nadaptability, while generative approaches improve efficiency and task\nintegration but generalize poorly to unseen objects and tasks due to data\nlimitations. In this paper, we propose a transfer-based framework for dexterous\ngrasp generation, leveraging a conditional diffusion model to transfer\nhigh-quality grasps from shape templates to novel objects within the same\ncategory. Specifically, we reformulate the grasp transfer problem as the\ngeneration of an object contact map, incorporating object shape similarity and\ntask specifications into the diffusion process. To handle complex shape\nvariations, we introduce a dual mapping mechanism, capturing intricate\ngeometric relationship between shape templates and novel objects. Beyond the\ncontact map, we derive two additional object-centric maps, the part map and\ndirection map, to encode finer contact details for more stable grasps. We then\ndevelop a cascaded conditional diffusion model framework to jointly transfer\nthese three maps, ensuring their intra-consistency. Finally, we introduce a\nrobust grasp recovery mechanism, identifying reliable contact points and\noptimizing grasp configurations efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe superiority of our proposed method. Our approach effectively balances grasp\nquality, generation efficiency, and generalization performance across various\ntasks. Project homepage: https://cmtdiffusion.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Soft robots employing compliant materials and deformable structures offer\ngreat potential for wearable devices that are comfortable and safe for human\ninteraction. However, achieving both structural integrity and compliance for\ncomfort remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a novel\nfabrication and design method that combines the advantages of origami\nstructures with the material programmability and wearability of knitted\nfabrics. We introduce a general design method that translates origami patterns\ninto knit designs by programming both stitch and material patterns. The method\ncreates folds in preferred directions while suppressing unintended buckling and\nbending by selectively incorporating heat fusible yarn to create rigid panels\naround compliant creases. We experimentally quantify folding moments and show\nthat stitch patterning enhances folding directionality while the heat fusible\nyarn (1) keeps geometry consistent by reducing edge curl and (2) prevents\nout-of-plane deformations by stiffening panels. We demonstrate the framework\nthrough the successful reproduction of complex origami tessellations, including\nMiura-ori, Yoshimura, and Kresling patterns, and present a wearable knitted\nKaleidocycle robot capable of locomotion. The combination of structural\nreconfigurability, material programmability, and potential for manufacturing\nscalability highlights knitted origami as a promising platform for\nnext-generation wearable robotics.",

    "abstract": "Achieving precise control of robotic tool paths is often challenged by\ninherent system misalignments, unmodeled dynamics, and actuation inaccuracies.\nThis work introduces an Iterative Learning Control (ILC) strategy to enable\nprecise rotational insertion of a tool during robotic surgery, improving\npenetration efficacy and safety compared to straight insertion tested in\nsubretinal injection. A 4 degree of freedom (DOF) robot manipulator is used,\nwhere misalignment of the fourth joint complicates the simple application of\nneedle rotation, motivating an ILC approach that iteratively adjusts joint\ncommands based on positional feedback. The process begins with calibrating the\nforward kinematics for the chosen surgical tool to achieve higher accuracy,\nfollowed by successive ILC iterations guided by Optical Coherence Tomography\n(OCT) volume scans to measure the error and refine control inputs. Experimental\nresults, tested on subretinal injection tasks on ex vivo pig eyes, show that\nthe optimized trajectory resulted in higher success rates in tissue penetration\nand subretinal injection compared to straight insertion, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of ILC in overcoming misalignment challenges. This approach\noffers potential applications for other high precision robot tasks requiring\ncontrolled insertions as well.",

    "abstract": "Endowed with inherent dynamical properties that grant them remarkable\nruggedness and adaptability, spherical tensegrity robots stand as prototypical\nexamples of hybrid softrigid designs and excellent mobile platforms. However,\npath planning for these robots in unknown environments presents a significant\nchallenge, requiring a delicate balance between efficient exploration and\nrobust planning. Traditional path planners, which treat the environment as a\ngeometric grid, often suffer from redundant searches and are prone to failure\nin complex scenarios due to their lack of semantic understanding. To overcome\nthese limitations, we reframe path planning in unknown environments as a\nsemantic reasoning task. We introduce a Semantic Agent for Tensegrity robots\n(SATPlanner) driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). SATPlanner leverages\nhigh-level environmental comprehension to generate efficient and reliable\nplanning strategies.At the core of SATPlanner is an Adaptive Observation Window\nmechanism, inspired by the \"fast\" and \"slow\" thinking paradigms of LLMs. This\nmechanism dynamically adjusts the perceptual field of the agent: it narrows for\nrapid traversal of open spaces and expands to reason about complex obstacle\nconfigurations. This allows the agent to construct a semantic belief of the\nenvironment, enabling the search space to grow only linearly with the path\nlength (O(L)) while maintaining path quality. We extensively evaluate\nSATPlanner in 1,000 simulation trials, where it achieves a 100% success rate,\noutperforming other real-time planning algorithms. Critically, SATPlanner\nreduces the search space by 37.2% compared to the A* algorithm while achieving\ncomparable, near-optimal path lengths. Finally, the practical feasibility of\nSATPlanner is validated on a physical spherical tensegrity robot prototype.",

SCP enables the model to\nlearn correct actions and precise action token numbers. Following SCP, the\nmodel is fine-tuned on target embodiment data. To further enhance the model\nperformance on multi-embodiment, we present the Embodied Graph-of-Thought\ntechnique, a novel approach that formulates each sub-task as a node, that\nallows the VLA model to distinguish the functionalities and roles of each\nembodiment during task execution.

This paper explores a training method for\ndomain adaptation to adapt PilotNet, an end-to-end deep learning-based model,\nfor left-hand driving conditions using real-world Australian highway data. Four\ntraining methods were evaluated: (1) a baseline model trained on U.S.\nright-hand driving data, (2) a model trained on flipped U.S. data, (3) a model\npretrained on U.S. data and then fine-tuned on Australian highways, and (4) a\nmodel pretrained on flipped U.S. data and then finetuned on Australian\nhighways. This setup examines whether incorporating flipped data enhances the\nmodel adaptation by providing an initial left-hand driving alignment. The paper\ncompares model performance regarding steering prediction accuracy and\nattention, using saliency-based analysis to measure attention shifts across\nsignificant road regions. Results show that pretraining on flipped data alone\nworsens prediction stability due to misaligned feature representations, but\nsignificantly improves adaptation when followed by fine-tuning, leading to\nlower prediction error and stronger focus on left-side cues. To validate this\napproach across different architectures, the same experiments were done on\nResNet, which confirmed similar adaptation trends.

For this purpose, a passive\n2-D global relocalization framework is proposed. It estimates the global pose\nefficiently and reliably from a single LiDAR scan and an occupancy grid map\nwhile the robot remains stationary, thereby enhancing the long-term autonomy of\nmobile robots. The proposed framework casts global relocalization as a\nnon-convex problem and solves it via the multi-hypothesis scheme with batched\nmulti-stage inference and early termination, balancing completeness and\nefficiency. The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), under traversability\nconstraints, asymptotically covers the reachable space to generate sparse,\nuniformly distributed feasible positional hypotheses, fundamentally reducing\nthe sampling space. The hypotheses are preliminarily ordered by the proposed\nScan Mean Absolute Difference (SMAD), a coarse beam-error level metric that\nfacilitates the early termination by prioritizing high-likelihood candidates.\nThe SMAD computation is optimized for non-panoramic scans. And the\nTranslation-Affinity Scan-to-Map Alignment Metric (TAM) is proposed for\nreliable orientation selection at hypothesized positions and accurate final\npose evaluation to mitigate degradation in conventional likelihood-field\nmetrics under translational uncertainty induced by sparse hypotheses, as well\nas non-panoramic LiDAR scan and environmental changes. Real-world experiments\non a resource-constrained mobile robot with non-panoramic LiDAR scan\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in both\nglobal relocalization success rate and computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) has been widely used for enhancing the performance\nof graph collaborative filtering (GCF) for personalized recommendation. Since\ndata augmentation plays a crucial role in the success of CL, previous works\nhave designed augmentation methods to remove noisy interactions between users\nand items in order to generate effective augmented views. However, the\nambiguity in defining ''noisiness'' presents a persistent risk of losing core\ninformation and generating unreliable data views, while increasing the overall\ncomplexity of augmentation. In this paper, we propose Simple Collaborative\nAugmentation for Recommendation (SCAR), a novel and intuitive augmentation\nmethod designed to maximize the effectiveness of CL for GCF. Instead of\nremoving information, SCAR leverages collaborative signals extracted from\nuser-item interactions to generate pseudo-interactions, which are then either\nadded to or used to replace existing interactions. This results in more robust\nrepresentations while avoiding the pitfalls of overly complex augmentation\nmodules. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets and show that SCAR\noutperforms previous CL-based GCF methods as well as other state-of-the-art\nself-supervised learning approaches across key evaluation metrics. SCAR\nexhibits strong robustness across different hyperparameter settings and is\nparticularly effective in sparse data scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Recently, augmenting vision-language-action models (VLAs) with world-models\nhas shown promise in robotic policy learning. However, it remains challenging\nto jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences because of the\ninherent difference between the two modalities. To address this, we propose\nDUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework that\nhandles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across\ndiverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer\narchitecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while enabling\ncross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we propose training techniques such\nas independent noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow\nmatching loss, which enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a\nbidirectional manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space.\nFurthermore, based on the decoupled training framework, we introduce a sampling\nmethod where we sample action and vision tokens asynchronously at different\nrates, which shows improvement through inference-time scaling. Through\nexperiments on simulated benchmarks such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up\nto 6% gains over a standard VLA baseline and implicit world-modeling methods,\nwith our inference-time scaling approach providing an additional 2-5% gain on\nsuccess rate. On real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST outperforms\nbaselines in success rate by 13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond\nsimulation. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DUST in large-scale\npretraining with action-free videos from BridgeV2, where DUST leads to\nsignificant gain when transferred to the RoboCasa benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in\ndomains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface\nmanipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall\ninto two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through\nbehavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that\ncan take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which\noften collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on\ndomain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that\nintegrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.\nInstead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to\nintervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing\nprior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it\npossible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable\ntrajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter\nout sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these\ncomponents enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon\nenvironments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using\nInnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5\nmodel on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the\nuntrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human\ninteraction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop\nsampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks.",

While holding\ngreat promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they\ncould also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the\nrisk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous\ndata during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach\nremains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune\nthese models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose \\eval, a\nframework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce\nthe dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. \\eval assesses models'\nvirus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling,\nmutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that\ncurrent filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded\nknowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits\nbroader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals\nmay already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via\nsimple linear probing.

    "abstract": "Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon\nmethods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret\ndiffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation. However, these\nmethods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high\nscanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the\noperating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases\nfor the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced\nindexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine\nlearning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi\npatterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high\nscan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of\ncrystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the\nperformance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns\ncaptured at short exposure times (high scan speeds). An interesting observation\nis that the methodology is not data-hungry as typical machine learning methods.",

    "abstract": "Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and\nthe exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models\n(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract\nfine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also\nhinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel \"ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)\" to provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting\ntabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various\nattributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON\ntemplate to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically\ntailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference\nworkflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs capability to align and\ncompare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on\nseveral recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,\nweaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These\nfindings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart\nunderstanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened\nin current models.",

Our research investigates how different\nlevels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,\nextending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories\ninto a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view\nvideos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),\nor high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we\ntriangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and\nuncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and\nqualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.",

Aeolus addresses this\nlimitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with\nrich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million\nflights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along\nsequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and\n(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport\nresource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset\nis carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and\nstrict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine\nlearning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including\nregression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,\nserving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph\nmodalities.

    "abstract": "Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in\napplications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and\nrecommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are\nlimited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,\nreal-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.\nFor example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses\ndifferently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying\nsimilarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under\nscenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling\nthe imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are\nunderrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering\nof Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets\nfrom multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize\nutility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose\nOff-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on\noffline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that\nexplicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the\nsecond challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting\nwith active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited\nnumber of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster\nstructure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,\nA$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative\ndimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively\ncollected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we\nvalidate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets.",

We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which\nselect active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable\nlatency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In\naddition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based\non fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and\nworkloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.\n  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE\ninference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.\nExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by\nleveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter\ndimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a\nhybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with\nintermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By\nadaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage\nbehavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency\ncaused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces\nmodel stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability\nto optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.",

    "abstract": "Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a\nscalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless\nmultiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for\ntextual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to\nreason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute\nthis text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction\ntuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal\narchitecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual\nKeys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned\nduring language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive\nsystematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to\ntheir under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this\nhypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their\ndistributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative\n(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that\nvisual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention\nspace. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding\nintra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal\nthat text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key\nspace rather than solely from external data factors.",

Progressive prompt\nengineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without\nexplicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning\ncapabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,\nagent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,\nand future research.",

    "abstract": "Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite\nbeing an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about\nfinding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph\nthat have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to\nreason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,\nstronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,\nwe present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow\nmatching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4\ndiverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results\nagainst 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,\ndemonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and\nperceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly\neffective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given\nlow-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that\nResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior\ndistribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,\nenabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can\nguide future users to reject uncertain predictions.",

In\nthis paper, we formalize this challenge as the \\textbf{Reward Density\nOptimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of\nexploration cost. This paper introduce \\textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic\nframework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \\textbf{Subproblem\ndecomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,\nthereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \\textbf{Failure-guided hints}:\ninjecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the\nprobability of successful outcomes. 3) \\textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:\nemploying a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep\nexploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively\ncompresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration\ncost and increasing the overall reward density.

    "abstract": "Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted\nprobabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class\nfrequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong\ncalibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities\nto be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing\napproaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,\nwhich makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of\nthe feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant\nin high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are\nexactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this\nmain shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.\nFirst, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its\nrelationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the\npitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local\ncalibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local\ncalibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted\nprobabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon\ndistance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing\nmulticlass calibration techniques.",

We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer\nlanguage models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,\nprovide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual\nlandscape, and examine key design considerations for practice.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number\nof domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these\nmodels often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,\nrequire substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across\ndomains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high\ncomputational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian\nnetwork LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three\nLLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic\nmechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the\nsentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a\nBayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with\ndistinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates\nconsistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,\nunderscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of\nprobabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.",

    "abstract": "Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the\nreasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models\nexplore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on\nQwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks\ndemonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning\ncapabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.",

Code review serves as an effective practice that enables\ndevelopers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.\nTo streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review\napproaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly\nadvanced the capabilities of automated review generation.

To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new\napproach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve\nsecurity-related issues during code review.

To mitigate hallucination in\nLLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG\ntechnique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security\nknowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric\ndesigned to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security\nissues.

However, unauthorized commercial use of\nthese datasets severely violates the intellectual property rights of dataset\nowners. Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer\nfrom inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to\nlabel inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical\ncomplexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches\nemploy static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label\nbackdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked\nsample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,\nfundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The\ncore innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three\ncomponents: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target\nsample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss\nmaintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box\ntesting is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined\nbackdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential\nwatermark removal attacks.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a\n\"Cambrian explosion\" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a\npragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood\nnot as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of\nobligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities\nfor a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We\nargue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions\nfor different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --\nsuch as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target \"individual\" that can\nbe sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's\nconsciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles\nand discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining\nboth \"personhood as a problem\", where design choices can create \"dark patterns\"\nthat exploit human social heuristics, and \"personhood as a solution\", where\nconferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or\nprevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential\ndefinition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way\nto think about integrating AI agents into our society.",

    "abstract": "Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.\nWhile recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image\nsegmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their\neffectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we\npropose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel\ntwo-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation\naccuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior\nnetwork and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse\nlocalization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial\nguidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises\nfour essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric\ncross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to\nexisting segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on\ncomprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative\ndata subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while\nretaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a\nmodel-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective\nperformance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a\nitem-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection\nshould be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,\nrather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by\nover 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM\nLeaderboard, using just a 0.5\\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores\nwith a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach\nenables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity\ndegradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more\ninterpretable benchmarking.",

Our experiments with diverse\nLLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent\ngroups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with\nspecific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines\non downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of\nmanually-curated teams based on known model specializations.

    "abstract": "Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining\ncausal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed\ninterventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional\ndata. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We\nevaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating\ninterventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures\nconsistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also\nfacilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be\ncostly to identify.",

Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed\nto satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual\nrealism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.",

Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for\ntasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several\nheuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior\nsampling is computationally intractable in general.\n  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave\ndistributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior\nsamples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to\nscore--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By\ncontrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an\n$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with\nan annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in\npolynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.",

    "abstract": "Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require\na regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to\nalign semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative\nelements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate\ncontributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured\nrepresentations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.",

In this work, we study the implicit bias\nof incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on\nlinearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the\nfull-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured\ndatasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\\ell_2$-max-margin\nclassifier, in contrast to the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch\nAdam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the\nlimiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\\beta_2 \\to 1$ and we characterize\nits convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.\nFinally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges\nto the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\\beta$\nclose enough to 1.

Existing approaches often\nemploy an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the\ndiffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a\nblack-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the\ndiffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate\nsamples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG\nperforms weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according\nto the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling\nstrategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to\nour desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the\nmulti-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood\ninterpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional\nmulti-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective\nmolecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single\ngeneration pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline\noptimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.\nNotably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can\nbe integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.",

Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

    "abstract": "With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is\nessential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone\nto hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may\ncause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection\ntypes present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and\ncross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous\nintersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable\nTSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning\nframework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency\nscenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to\ndistill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the\nreliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this\npaper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a\nReward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3\nadaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with\nenvironment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed\nreward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies\nacross heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17\nto 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC\nreduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle\nwaiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.",

These datasets\ncapture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique\nchallenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot\nreasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire\ndata or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains\nunderexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,\nSPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such\ndata integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves\nscientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on\nhow to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by\nintroducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a\nbenchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,\nrespondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and\nmultiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing\nan effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%\npoints compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a\nlightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further\nimprovements of 3-4% points on average.

    "abstract": "As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works\ntypically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to\nachieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such\nsolutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical\nrequirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to\nthe existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential\nprocess where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \\emph{inductive\napproach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.\nThis is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end\nof the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original\ndataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This\nenables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing\nclassification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple\nexperiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using\nCNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).\nExperiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model\nwith a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,\nscalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the\nperformance of the output in a more practical setting.",

Current RAG evaluation\nbenchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant\nchunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only\nlocalized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and\nbaselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,\nwith the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that\npreserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates\nLLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates\naggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,\nGlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,\nvalidating the effectiveness of our method.",

While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,\nlength or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without\npre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human\nFeedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.\nWIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring\nand (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7\ndatasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that\naccount for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by\nblack-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction.

    "abstract": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their\npractical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

The\nlearned representations successfully capture known investment styles, such as\n\"growth\" and \"value,\" while also revealing implicit manager objectives. For\ninstance, we find that while many funds exhibit characteristics of\nMarkowitz-like optimization, they do so with heterogeneous realizations for\nturnover, concentration, and latent factors.\n  To analyze and interpret the end-to-end model, we develop a series of tests\nthat explain the model, and we show that the benchmark's expert labeling are\ncontained in our model's encoding in a linear interpretable way.\n  Our framework provides a data-driven approach for characterizing investment\nstrategies for applications in market simulation, strategy attribution, and\nregulatory oversight.",

Specifically, we\naugment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment\nsignals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To\neffectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs\nsubstructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement\nmechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals.

    "abstract": "Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided\nDiagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,\nacquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and\ntime-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are\npre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing\nrobustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces\na novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer\nclassification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram\nimages and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view\nsupervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by\nemploying cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes\nmultiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a\nnovel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and\naccuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast\ntissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these\npatterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated\nour method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that\nthe proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three\nclassification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype\nclassification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the\nmodel exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised\nor VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need\nfor actual radiology reports.",

However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily\nfeature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of\nthese systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.",

We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts\nover Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a\nset of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to\nstratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:\nterritory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or\nwater). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual\nstratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual\ncountry). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of\nstate-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all\nexhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to\nseed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different\nlead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged\nmetrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and\nwhich models are most fair?

    "abstract": "Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and\nhigher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the\npotential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and\ncongestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.",

Existing video-to-4D methods\ntypically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive\nand brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches\nmitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera\ntrajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby\ndepicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this\ntrajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene\ndynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a\npose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory\nprediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby\nseparating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video\ninpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising\nrealistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing\nregions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D\nannotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal\nautoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and\nextends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at\nbounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation\nand sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and\nqualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and\nimproved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,\nadvancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.",

Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global\nclassification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while\ncross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain\ngap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a\nhybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large\ngeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification\ntask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly\nencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with\nembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of\nground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas\nspanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach can localize within 200m more than 68\\% of queries of a dataset\ncovering a large part of Europe.

In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most\nnotably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization\nin modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can\nleverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework\nthat systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key\npillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that\nintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions\nfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen\nmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed\nfor fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and\ngeneralization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human\nevaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

    "abstract": "CT reconstruction provides radiologists with images for diagnosis and\ntreatment, yet current deep learning methods are typically limited to specific\nanatomies and datasets, hindering generalization ability to unseen anatomies\nand lesions. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Organ medical image\nREconstruction (MORE) dataset, comprising CT scans across 9 diverse anatomies\nwith 15 lesion types. This dataset serves two key purposes: (1) enabling robust\ntraining of deep learning models on extensive, heterogeneous data, and (2)\nfacilitating rigorous evaluation of model generalization for CT reconstruction.\nWe further establish a strong baseline solution that outperforms prior\napproaches under these challenging conditions. Our results demonstrate that:\n(1) a comprehensive dataset helps improve the generalization capability of\nmodels, and (2) optimization-based methods offer enhanced robustness for unseen\nanatomies.

In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image\nQuality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity\nlevels.

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,\nclimate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer\nvision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,\nhas advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical\nproblems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical\nflow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,\nwhich limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based\napproaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in\ncomputer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We\npresent the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models\non RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and\nFl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer\naccuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the\nspatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the\nArctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing\nconsistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical\nflow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy\ncompared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote\nsensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing\nmotion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,\noffering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.",

Emu3.5 is pre-trained\nend-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of\nvision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily\nderived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model\nnaturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved\nvision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale\nreinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To\nimprove inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),\nwhich converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,\naccelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.\nEmu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon\nvision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex\ntext-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling\nabilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and\nopen-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For\ncomparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image\n(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior\nresults on a suite of interleaved generation tasks.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA\nleveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,\ntheir generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain\nscenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to\nlarge distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation\nmechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or\nbespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across\ndiverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for\ncross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while\nrequiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to\ndecouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight\nmodules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual\nadapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a\nVisual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically\ninjected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone\nmodel. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without\nretraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on\nMedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH\nprovides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling\npractical deployment across diverse application domains.",

The UAV dataset, acquired over\nVicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks.

    "abstract": "Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),\nplays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical\napplications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,\nthe global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect\nthe high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine\nbones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,\nwhich deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network\n(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a\nscale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional\nlong-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the\nconsistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic\nlevel affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform\nsemantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a\nTransformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a\nfeature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method\nimproves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior\nsegmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability\nof pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous\nregions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.\nHowever, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can\nonly pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to\nidentify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment\nbetween image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving\nsub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose\nthe Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and\nfine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with\nautomatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel\nframework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,\nwhich consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and\nMulti-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics\ninto multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and\nconcatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and\nmulti-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align\nwith corresponding visual regions.

    "abstract": "Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for\nadapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on\nlabeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt\ncalibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel\nTPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the\ndistribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable\nprompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular\ndistance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate\naverage calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through\nextensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,\nour approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural\ndistribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide\nextensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding\nof A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to\nachieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM\ncalibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly\navailable.",

Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\nnine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well\non basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event\nconsistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.\nOverall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for\nevaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical\ndirections for future method improvement.",

    "abstract": "Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.\nWhile recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image\nsegmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their\neffectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we\npropose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel\ntwo-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation\naccuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior\nnetwork and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse\nlocalization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial\nguidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises\nfour essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric\ncross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to\nexisting segmentation methods.

    "abstract": "Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from\nsurveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because\nrecovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable\ndownstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed\nto satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual\nrealism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.",

To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early\ndetection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently\nestablished based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer\n(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of\nexisting methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One\npotential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of\nbackbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them\n(\\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global\nfeature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to\neffectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the\ntheory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm\ntransforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via\na set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the\naggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively\ntune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the\nperformance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly\navailable DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nhybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability\nfor feature fusion and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of\nbalancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images\nby learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain\nlimited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection\nfurther affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex\nscenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion\nunder the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and\nvisible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the\nquantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,\nwhich leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational\nbottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and\ninformation decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal\ninformation, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural\ndetails. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion\nmodel is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical\nguidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at\ndifferent stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the\nintrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nfusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple\ndatasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully\ndemonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing\ninspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and\ndetail quality.",

A\nmajor obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with\nManhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres\nsuch as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address\nthis gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse\ndocument layouts, covering six common document types and comprising\ncontemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing\nmethods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences\ncoherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage\nCoarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from\nOmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the\nknowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations.

The management of risks that occur\nin a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the\nsustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the\nsupply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential\nelement in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in\nthe context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed\nto analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to\npropose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric\nnetwork (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This\nnetwork is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to\nderive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the\nproposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The\nSupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction\nof delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The\nproduct classification and edge classification are performed using the\nSupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An\naverage accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk\nmanagement. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for\nsustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4\nproduct relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%\nis attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an\naverage improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer\nanimation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this\ntask presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature\nof sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of\nlarge-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with\nheuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in\ngeneralizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach\nleveraging a \"learn from synthesis\" strategy. First, a diffusion model is\ntrained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human\nposes, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process\nenables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k\naccurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building\non this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for\nestimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework\ncombines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch\nfeature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose\nestimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee\ngeometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses\nwhile preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and\nsubjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses\nprevious ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.",

Researchers have investigated various\nmethods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including\nblur kernels and optical flow.

In this paper, we\npropose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework\nusing Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion\nrepresentations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality\nfrom a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key\ncomponents: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale\nfeature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new\ntraining method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained\nmotion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a\nmotion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory.

We design three tasks:\nsingle-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn\nconversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for\nboth image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that\nstraightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM\nsingle- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry\nsolutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for\nimprovement.

In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the\nmost common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,\nrickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto\n(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of\nauto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from\naccessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite\ndifficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially\nnon-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This\npaper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect\nauto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object\ndetection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of\n1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The\nresults show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw\ndetection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values\nabove 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse\ntraffic scenarios.

    "abstract": "Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided\nDiagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,\nacquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and\ntime-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are\npre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing\nrobustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces\na novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer\nclassification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram\nimages and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view\nsupervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by\nemploying cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes\nmultiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a\nnovel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and\naccuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast\ntissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these\npatterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated\nour method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that\nthe proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three\nclassification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype\nclassification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the\nmodel exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised\nor VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need\nfor actual radiology reports.",

    "abstract": "Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution\nof video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several\nchallenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and\ncomputational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR\nfor AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency\npriors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation\nunit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a\nsecond-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of\nadjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and\ncontent-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we\ninstantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for\nstrictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a\nlimited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a\nbidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources\nare less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nadaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive\nexperiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods\nin terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference\nspeed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends\nits core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios.

    "abstract": "Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.\nPrevious part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens\noften suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts\nan explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all\nparts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to\ndegraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that\ncombines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding\nbox layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that\nimplicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little\ngeometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed\nfull-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,\neach part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,\nenabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a\ncenter-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when\nexchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby\nmaintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part\ndata, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to\ndate with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation.

However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily\nfeature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of\nthese systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.",

Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound\n(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear\nas cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can\nprovide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly\ntrained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert\nannotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this\nchallenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)\nframework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an\nintra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of\nframes, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate\nvarious image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL\nand introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model\nperformance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation\nstrategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist\nand elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It\noutperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and\nconventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice\ncoefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential\nof FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well\nsuited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and\ntransferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's\nrobustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on\nout-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods.",

    "abstract": "In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been\npredominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between\nentities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

    "abstract": "As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and\nmore confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their\ngeneral knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.\nTherefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a\ncrucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the\nalignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which\nmodels learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at\nwhich stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's\npost-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training\nalgorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts\nduring training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different\nsizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization\ndatasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a\nmodel's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these\nvalues. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of values, we find that different preference\noptimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when\npreference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into\nhow values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,\nas well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization\nto improve model alignment to human values.",

Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware\nefficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)\ntransition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the\ngeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical\ndelta rule.\n  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total\nparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention\n(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear\noutperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while\nreducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding\nthroughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be\na drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior\nperformance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output\nlengths.\n  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM\nimplementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model\ncheckpoints.",

Specifically, Evontree extracts\ndomain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core\nontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled\nfine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with\nLlama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both\nunmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%\nimprovement in accuracy.

    "abstract": "Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic\nmodality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their\nability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain\nfrom both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs\nreason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with\nnormative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a\ncommon formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a\nwide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic\ndomains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence\nhuman reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to\nvalid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific\ntypes of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those\nobserved in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight\nchallenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and\nprovide insights for enhancing their reliability.

A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively\ncompresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration\ncost and increasing the overall reward density.

We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of\nrelations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer\nlanguage models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and\nconsensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were\ntested for rating the performance of the triage tool.\n  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The\nhighest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).\nThe average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).\nLlama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater\nprecision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the\nideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3\nEnsemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522\n(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between\nTop-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).\n  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a\nmore consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective\nevaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.",

With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,\nprovide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual\nlandscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing\nthese questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context\nengineering and sketch its promising future.

This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in\nlanguage comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is\nconstrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning\nand low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance\nindividually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce\n\\underline{S}ynergistic \\underline{S}parse and \\underline{L}ow-Rank\n\\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths\nof both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining\nits essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse\noptimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for\ngeneralization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank\napproximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by\niterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models\n(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently\nsurpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,\nSSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\\% with no performance drop and achieves at least\n1.63$\\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM\ndeployment.",

    "abstract": "Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge\nin software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can\naccurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended\nfor a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent\nframework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging\na diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a\nstructured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.\nDuring the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each\nembodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines\nan initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates\na plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed\noracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this\nexecution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using\nthe specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before\nre-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks\ndemonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms\nstate-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle\naccuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The\nimproved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug\ndetection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases\nfrom 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of\nautomated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based\nworks have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing\nLLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely\nneglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for\nreal-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often\nlimited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.\nThis issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address\nthis gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational\nbenchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.\nThe data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge\ndimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K\nentries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained\ncategories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and\n20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of\nquestion formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid\nfoundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.\nExtensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs\nreveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro\nsurpassed 60\\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the\nbest-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\\%.\nThese results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the\nchallenges of applying LLMs in education.",

To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated\nCurriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain\nexperts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a\ncomprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for\na subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's\ntaxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing\ndifficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining\nwith an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content\nand cognitive dimensions.\n  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized\nMMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines\nstruggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target\ndomains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage\npoints. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also\nfacilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on\nnon-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on\nknowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,\nwhile maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks.

We instead analyze\ninternal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)\nexternal signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;\n(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than\nincorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct\nresponses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones\ndiverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding\n(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using\nactivation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on\ninternal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables\nearly correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports\naggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable\nanswers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where\nmajority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64.

However, current watermarking solutions hardly\nresolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself\nfaithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the\nsecret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or\nthe adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be\nprivate, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the\ndilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),\nenabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third\nparties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of\n`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints\nare built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and\nsummation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,\ncovering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and\nfour ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of\ncircumstances.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a\nproblem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While\nKnowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring\nknowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an\nunderexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD\nbehavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on\ncross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability\nunder model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP\nand SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual\nQA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual\nretrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain\ncross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate\naccuracy alone does not reveal.",

    "abstract": "Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another\nand gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can\noften differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in\nbilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical\nitems on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained\nlanguage models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities\nfor loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.\nDespite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that\nmodels perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These\nfindings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias\ntoward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for\ndeveloping NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language\npreservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to\nreducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation\nbenchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant\nchunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only\nlocalized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and\nbaselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,\nwith the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that\npreserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates\nLLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates\naggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,\nGlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,\nvalidating the effectiveness of our method.",

While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,\nlength or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without\npre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human\nFeedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.\nWIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring\nand (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7\ndatasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that\naccount for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by\nblack-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction.

    "abstract": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their\npractical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)\nand Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nprompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we\ntook the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point\nand developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with\none of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10\ndifferent prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using\ndifferent majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of\ninstances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The\nsilver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on\nthe majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver\ndatasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,\nCause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive\ntexts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,\nRepetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online\npropaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of\neffective communication.",

    "abstract": "While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning\nability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often\nbecomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common \"one problem, one\nsolution\" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer\nand can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we\npropose a \"one problem, multiple solutions\" (1PNS) training paradigm that\nexposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus\nincreases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring\nsemantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce\nReasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores\nLong Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate\nreasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and\nfine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields\nmore varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16\nover a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that\n1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS.

Second, it\nincorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming\ncontests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of\nLLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even\nadvanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting\nthe difficulty of the benchmark.

However, its effect on model's\nrobustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on\nout-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods.",

Objective To develop, validate, and\ndeploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in\nradiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior\nthyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from\nJuly 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline\nidentified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from\nmultiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of\nITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer\ndiagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related\nfactors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%\nwomen), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more\nlikely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was\nordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were\nmore likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule\ncharacteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other\nfeatures in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients\nwithout ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,\nbiopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were\npapillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were\ncommon and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,\nlow-risk cancers.

PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty\nover linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise\nshifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that\nTransformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on\nunseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published\nclassical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up\nto $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.\nSurprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can\nbe reliably predicted by the model.

We demonstrate a scaling law with\nmodulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for\nnear-perfect prediction grows as $\\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization\nenters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \\geq\n2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating\na critical necessity for curriculum learning.

    "abstract": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and\nthe regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the\nbalancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction\nterm, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,\ncovariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating\nthe balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE\nin the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is\nin a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for\nconstructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term\nbecomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density\nRatio Estimation and Riesz Regression.",

We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

    "abstract": "The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a\ntreatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major\napproaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)\napproach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a\nclassification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population\nwelfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by\nmaximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on\nregression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect\n(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.\nThis study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are\nbased on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an\nexact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of\nthe policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in\nseveral respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common\nconditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization\nmethod for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally\nefficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step\ntypically required in EWM.",

    "abstract": "Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a\nscalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless\nmultiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines.",

Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different\nsizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization\ndatasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a\nmodel's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these\nvalues. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of values, we find that different preference\noptimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when\npreference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into\nhow values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,\nas well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization\nto improve model alignment to human values.",

While inspired by active\nlearning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and\nthe core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost\nand predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our\nalgorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.\nEmpirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially\nreduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating\nthe practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead\nto known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are\nattractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and\ninterpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural\nnetworks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator\nhave been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To\naddress this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network\ntraining that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical\nBayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior\nmean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis\ncharacterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its\ninverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and\ndemonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a\nstable and interpretable way.",

This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse\nensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of \\textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of\nsimulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz\ndesign for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image\nclassification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing.

However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference.

We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs.

    "abstract": "Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level\nobservations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely\non key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful\nlearning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de\nfacto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action\nthat results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an\nenergy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world\nsystems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit\nnon-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this\npaper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is\ncapable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in\nstark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is\nconstructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.\nWe showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single\ncells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate\nvelocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better\nmatch both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands\nflow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the\nmodeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems.

Therefore, the only scalable and viable\nsolution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected\nfrom diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,\nbased on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to\nrun. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to\ntime series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based\napproaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper\nstudies the performance of time series classification methods used as model\nselection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations\nderived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we\npropose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series\nclassification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results\ndemonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly\ndetection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution\ntime. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and\nefficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and\nrepresents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection\nstep in general AutoML pipelines.

However,\nBO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.\nRecent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the\nrelationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we\ndevelop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a\nsystematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this\nframework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either\nrelated or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in\nour experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results\npresented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially\nwhen the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In\ncontrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,\nwe show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to\nachieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow\nor complex algorithms.",

Existing datasets in this domain are\ntypically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the\nspatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this\nlimitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with\nrich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million\nflights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along\nsequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and\n(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport\nresource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset\nis carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and\nstrict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine\nlearning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including\nregression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,\nserving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph\nmodalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to\nfacilitate adoption.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is\nbecoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often\nignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.\nTo overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the\nparameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the\nminimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance\nbetween the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which\ntakes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based\noptimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed\nmethod provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein\ndistance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced\nnonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than\nor comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,\nwhile maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via\ncontrol points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that\ncombines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.\nProspects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian\ndistributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and\nadapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating\nsurfaces and more complex structures.",

    "abstract": "Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted\nprobabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class\nfrequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong\ncalibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities\nto be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing\napproaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,\nwhich makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of\nthe feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant\nin high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are\nexactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this\nmain shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.\nFirst, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its\nrelationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the\npitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local\ncalibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local\ncalibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted\nprobabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon\ndistance.

To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose.

Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely\nadopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,\nhigh-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first\nvalidated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly\noutperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of\npredicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from\ntube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the\nstaged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,\npotentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.",

Speculative decoding methods have\nrecently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the\noutput distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic\ndraft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel \\emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,\nunderpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a\nfundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for\nmulti-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend\nbeyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our\ntheoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and\noptimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and\noverall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone\nimplementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to\naccelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model\nfamilies demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from\n$3.31\\times$ to $4.01\\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \\times$ for\nLLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \\times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \\times$ for\nQwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution.

We\nbenchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,\nMasked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized\nvia Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most\n512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection\nof OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise.

Current methods for this task operate under a\nmodel-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective\nperformance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors.

We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples.

Yet, their accurate\nand efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,\ninitialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.\nWhile data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the\ncomplex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic\nforecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow\nMatching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful\nprobabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric\ncirculation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast\nskillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20\ndays in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is\ncomparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes\nfor a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging\nFM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that\nSSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,\ndistinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by\ninternal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally\nefficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and\nshowcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of\natmosphere-climate dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model\ntraining across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling\nprivacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.\nHowever, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally\ndifferent neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain\nscarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to\nsupport architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate\nvariants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),\nstill presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate\nfederations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,\nCNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical\nheterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each\nclient's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,\nundermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,\nhave non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,\ncurrent methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose\nUnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous\nlocal networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a\nshared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to\nparameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean\ndistances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy\nbalancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and\nhippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior\nperformance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize\nproblem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes\nparticularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even\nadvanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in\nthese conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution\nclouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate\nreward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.\nThis paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying\nclassical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and\nnonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of\nmodifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,\nand the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to\nprevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte\nCarlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two\nexhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to\ncomplex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning\napproaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and\nreward-sparse environments.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining\ncausal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed\ninterventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional\ndata. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We\nevaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating\ninterventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures\nconsistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also\nfacilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be\ncostly to identify.",

First, we validate our approach in a\ncontrolled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of\nthe known $\\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5\ndegree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further\nreduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that\nlack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a\nreal-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.\nSABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with\nnear-zero error.

Data-free CL seeks to update models without\naccess to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to\nsynthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing\nsamples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)\ngenerating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between\nsynthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)\ninversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through\nthe full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as\nCLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),\ninspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides\nstrong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing\niterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via\nGaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between\nsynthetic and real features.

In many practical settings, however, user interactions are\nlimited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,\nreal-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.\nFor example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses\ndifferently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying\nsimilarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under\nscenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling\nthe imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are\nunderrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering\nof Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets\nfrom multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize\nutility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose\nOff-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on\noffline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that\nexplicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the\nsecond challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting\nwith active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited\nnumber of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster\nstructure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,\nA$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative\ndimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively\ncollected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones.

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to\nsimilar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These\nfindings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous\noutputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain\nthis conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify\nthe lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite\nsurfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable\nrepresentations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal\nacross their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to\ncreate universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the\ncauses of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental\nunderstanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the\npotential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'\narchitectures.",

    "abstract": "Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research\ninterest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple\nrelated tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.\nIn this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for\nlearning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the\nheterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a\nhierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while\naccommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that\noverlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce\nan empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior\ndistribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning\nacross multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient\nalgorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and\nebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which\nincorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide\nthe frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby\nfilling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our\nmethods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,\nhighlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation\nacross multi-bandits.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.\nThis capability has driven their application to high-dimensional\nmulti-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often\nemploy an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the\ndiffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a\nblack-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the\ndiffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate\nsamples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG\nperforms weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according\nto the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling\nstrategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to\nour desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the\nmulti-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood\ninterpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional\nmulti-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective\nmolecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single\ngeneration pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline\noptimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.\nNotably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can\nbe integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.",

    "abstract": "Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to\nidentify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats\nemerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly\nresolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself\nfaithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the\nsecret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or\nthe adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be\nprivate, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the\ndilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),\nenabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third\nparties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of\n`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints\nare built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and\nsummation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,\ncovering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and\nfour ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of\ncircumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public\nverifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without\ncompromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in\npractice.",

    "abstract": "Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving\ntheir general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable\nartificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such\nsolutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical\nrequirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to\nthe existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential\nprocess where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \\emph{inductive\napproach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.\nThis is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end\nof the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original\ndataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This\nenables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing\nclassification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple\nexperiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using\nCNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).\nExperiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model\nwith a high computational cost reduction.

    "abstract": "Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due\nto its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.\nHowever, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between\nmolecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn\nfine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text\nlearning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we\naugment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment\nsignals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To\neffectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs\nsubstructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement\nmechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show\nthat MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,\nhighlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text\nlearning.",

    "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)\npresents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart\nhomes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods\noften encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited\nfeasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.\nThis paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an\nedge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,\nadaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable\nreal-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR\nincorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural\nnetwork, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models\nwhile maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage\npre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth\nlow-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to\ndenoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device\ndeployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an\nembedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI\nacquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition\naccuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence\ndetection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference\nachieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering\nsixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response\nlatency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,\nprivacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and\npervasive computing environments.",

    "abstract": "Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) seeks to improve user\npreference modeling by transferring knowledge from multiple domains. Despite\nthe progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or\nitems to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in\nreal-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and\nmodel-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying\nmulti-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows\nthat naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several\ndomain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained\nsolely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first\nexperimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based\ncross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we\nintroduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and\ntarget domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging.\nWeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not\nintroduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory.\nFurthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the\nupper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments\non single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation\nscenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation\nand consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation\ntasks.",

To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates.

Such relational reasoning process reflects the\ndistinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another,\nmirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such\ninformation into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy\nof case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to\nleverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal\nreasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context\nlegal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language\nmodel. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and\nCOLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings\nsubstantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting\nthe potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems.\nThe code has been released on https://github.com/yanran-tang/ReaKase-8B.",

    "abstract": "In recommendation systems, scaling up feature-interaction modules (e.g.,\nWukong, RankMixer) or user-behavior sequence modules (e.g., LONGER) has\nachieved notable success. However, these efforts typically proceed on separate\ntracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also\nprevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans,\na unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior\nsequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer\nto convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token\nsequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar\nsequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential\ntokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables\nprecomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly\nreducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental\nresults on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales\nefficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.",

However,\napproaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to\njointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short\nstochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step\nconsistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump\ngeneration, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a\ntrajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a\ndenoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and\non a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step\nDDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing\nlatency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow\ninference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a\npractical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.",

    "abstract": "In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain\ndistribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment\nconditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.",

To support\nsystematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,\nconfigurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and\nscenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models\nvehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:\nmaximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The\nbenchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and\nvirtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together\nwith a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform\nimportance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare\nrepresentative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches\nunder identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario\ncombination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal\nsystematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform\ncapability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct\npreferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These\nobservations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform\ncapability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and\nselection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across\ndiverse platforms and scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and\nembodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,\nscalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing\napproaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical\nframeworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent\nmemory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long\nhorizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting\nthe need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,\nand robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel\nSpatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene\ngeometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared\nrepresentation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a\nbrain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global\nplanning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute\nactions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution\nenables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent\nstate synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex\ncoordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results\ndemonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous\nembodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and\nrobust multi-robot collaboration.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic\nmanipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with\nRL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at\nintermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but\noften underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose\nHi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection\nsampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS\nstabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during\nonline fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective\nto provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we\ndevelop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible\nonline human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for\nlearning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two\nembodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich\nmanipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL\nbaselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.\nNotably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by\nreliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better\nperformance.",

However,\nenabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such\nconditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a\nhumanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich\nenvironments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive\ntorso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like\nresponses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional\nchallenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning\narchitecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each\ncomponent shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its\nparameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially\noutperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot\nachieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body\nweight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing\nimprovements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the\nbest-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack\n(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N).

To illustrate the\ncontrast between EI-inspired systems and traditional architectures that\ndecouple sensing, computation, and actuation, we present and discuss a\ncollection of robots developed by the author and his team at the Autonomous\nMicrorobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL). These robots exhibit intelligent\nbehavior that emerges from their structural dynamics and the physical\ninteraction between their components and with the environment. Platforms such\nas the Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, and FRISSHBot\nexemplify how feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart\nactuation strategies can be embedded into the physical properties of the\nrobotic system itself. Along these lines, we contend that co-design is not only\na method for empirical optimization under constraints, but also an enabler of\nEI, offering a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for\nrobotics at the mm-to-cm-scale.",

    "abstract": "Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating\nsignificant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class\nactivation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify\nregions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.\nFurthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more\ngeneralizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.\nHowever, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated\ndirectly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains\nlimited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations\nenriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In\nthis work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D\nindoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information\nderived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve\nframe association performance. Experimental results indicate improved\nperformance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.",

Our research investigates how different\nlevels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,\nextending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories\ninto a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view\nvideos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),\nor high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we\ntriangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and\nuncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and\nqualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.",

Beyond\nrealistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual\nperception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still\nremains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging\nvisual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to\ncomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular\nVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including\nspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically\ncharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,\nwe curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables\nin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our\nfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning\npatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and\nlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal\nreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are\nnot yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging\nsigns as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\nProject page: https://video-cof.github.io",

    "abstract": "A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.\nGiven past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the\nembodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.",

    "abstract": "How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?\nInfluence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and\nHessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is\nresource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach\ninvolves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method\noften results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in\nsample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling\ntechniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet\nrepresentative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic\ndistribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF\nestimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a\ntypical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the\nmodel forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the\nremaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory\nusage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.",

    "abstract": "As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how\nto retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns\nwhen to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety\nviolations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for\nmaking misaligned models safer after deployment.",

These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as\nbuilding blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All\nmodel components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient\ntraining with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT\npredicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level\nsemantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic\ncontent of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to\ninitialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.\nBIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to\nlocalized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image\nreconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and\nsurpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective\nmetrics.

Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target\nvelocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct\ndirections, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final\nedited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and\nattribute disentanglement.

    "abstract": "Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and\natom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow\nserial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the\ntip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its\napex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)\napproach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.\nUsing a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we\ndemonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be\nused to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.\nQuantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy\n(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to\neffectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image\nacquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled\ndata.

    "abstract": "Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,\nand animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on\noptimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision\nor on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric\napproximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D\ngeneration of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with\nthe advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending\nthese methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models\nposes significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a\ntraining-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of\ntraining a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a\npre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape\nprior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by\ntreating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images\ncaptured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the\nobject's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring\ntask-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our\nmethod generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts\nunderlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object\ncategories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D\ncompletes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art\napproaches in both quality and versatility.",

    "abstract": "Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread\nattention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base\nmodels, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE\nachieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06.

Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated\nvehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around\ncomplex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of\nunderwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater\nautonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive\nDepth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines\npre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,\nmetric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth\nmap with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with\nour proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves\nimproved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs\nefficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical\nunderwater inspection and intervention.

    "abstract": "Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing\nvisually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a\ncoherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather\nthan describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each\nAD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To\naddress this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first\ngenerates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then\nperforms auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and\ninformative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a\nsequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs\nconvey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture\nthe redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD\nsequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches\nthat rely on independent generations.",

Its parameter\nefficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where\nboth communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,\nglobal prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,\nwhile personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We\npropose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt\nTuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and\npersonalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we\nintroduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on\nclass-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each\ninput, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived\nfrom global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables\nper-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable\nparameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated\naveraging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,\nTinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT\nconsistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data\nheterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and\ngeneralizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.",

To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences\nwhile maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action\nRecognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D\nAction Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims\nto proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,\nhas been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample\nselection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to\nembed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,\ncombined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,\nis utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for\nannotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not\nnecessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may\nhave already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.\nTo solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active\nlearning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an\ninformative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of\nskeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of\nthe factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from\nEuclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning\nstrategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.\nExtensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.",

However, prior work often overlooks the tight\ncoupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex\ninter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device\nmulti-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.\nInstead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire\ninference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,\nallowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also\nintroduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that\ncaptures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain\naccuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for\nfine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during\ninference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and\ninput data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration\noptimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for\neach modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping\nmechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early\npredictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public\nmultimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-based multimodal testbed.

Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability\nto produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step\nacross different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps\nunder the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards\nare used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with\ntrajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use.

These annotations draw inspiration\nfrom cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,\nproviding a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art\nVLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even\nwith advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively\ngrounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research\nin anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require\nmulti-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement\nLearning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely\nsampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to\noverfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address\nthis gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that\nreformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical \"actions\". SRL\ntrains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing\nto each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between\nthe model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a\nstep-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all\nrollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert\ndemonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging\nproblems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training\nwith SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.\nBeyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software\nengineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework\nfor reasoning-oriented LLMs.",

In this work, we investigate\nthese assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse\nmultilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study\nchallenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find\nthat combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the\nin-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a\nsufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we\nobserve that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language\nthat serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits\nacross language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot\nlanguage from within a specific family does not consistently improve\nperformance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a\nsignificant \"curse of multilinguality\" as the number of training languages\nincreases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,\nwhen balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without\ncompromising performance, even in low-resource settings",

We\nfind that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence\nbut yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --\ncontinuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers\ncompetitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss\nhow usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To\nsupport further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during\npretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly\nreleasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a\nreproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,\nevaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.",

    "abstract": "Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they\nare often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams\nare presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce\nclear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction\nis to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which\ncan leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to\nthe complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,\nsufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality\nof LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose\nDiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration\ndiagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams\nas graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed\nedges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node\nalignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate\ndiagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,\nquantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show\nhow the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable\ninsights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams.

For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with\ncalendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect\nanomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing\nlanguage agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks\nthat lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to\nevaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the\nTool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering\ndiverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable\nexecution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604\ntools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to\nprofessional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools\nare based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we\nmay have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily\nensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we\nprovide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas\ncourses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark\nincludes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting\nwith multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is\nstrictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive\nevaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the\nbest-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate\nwith 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model\nDeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%.

The encoder uses masked spectral\npretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal\nalignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens.\nTo reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated\nselective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is\nregistered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving\npipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version\nbinding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the\nquantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and\nconfidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a\ngateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates\nwith differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization\nwithout weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are\npart of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion,\nrespiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1\nand calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and\nrejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification.",

Despite\nrecent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their\nability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of\nEHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,\nspecifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning\ninstruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M\nnon-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a\nthinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning\ndata at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced\nLLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage\ntraining paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and\nreinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and\ndiverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.\nLastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning\n42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR\nscenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including\nDeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and\nachieving a 10\\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT.

We propose a framework for\nassessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,\nintroducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as\ngenerated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic\nprogram. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids\nunnecessary inference.

This issue is particularly\ncritical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and\ntrustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nsystems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,\nmulti-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To\naddress this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful\nAdvanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built\nupon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative\nRefinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting\nprocess: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence\nsufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,\nprogressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base\nof over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates\nsuperior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA\nbenchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable\n97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a\nhigh Answer Correctness score of 74.3%.

To address this limitation, this paper\nstudies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of\ninformation asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and\nskills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein\nPuzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game.

We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier\nframework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication\nstrategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results\nhighlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when\nagents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.\nInterestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task\nperformance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule\nunderstanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an\nenvironment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules\nand complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration\nin AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles",

This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially\nrespond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal.\nOne under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality,\nencompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation\ntypes are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and\nsocial meaning in speech.

The hidden\nstate is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially\nlarge Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,\nmaking the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.\nAt each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding\nand processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical\nnonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state\nvia unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it\nunifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial\nobservation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control\nfor input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with\nup to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,\nand language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to\nobtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum\nmemory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit\nreadouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine\ntranslation.

This allows us to infer a dense,\nturn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,\ndecomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised\nlearning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action,\nstate_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,\n\\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader\nCalibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward\nmodel with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy\nof \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying\nsizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs\ninto a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,\nour model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,\nproving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,\nreal-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically\nviable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented\nLLM applications.",

    "abstract": "Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing\nvisually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a\ncoherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather\nthan describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each\nAD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To\naddress this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first\ngenerates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then\nperforms auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and\ninformative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a\nsequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs\nconvey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture\nthe redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD\nsequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches\nthat rely on independent generations.",

To address this gap, we\ninvestigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing\nsix metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one\nhand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA\nzero-shot direct assessment on the other hand.

Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and\ndemonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic\nequivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias\ntoward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to\ndetect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and\nLLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This\nmotivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond\ntext-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.",

This study examines\nLLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and\nwhether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show\nthat larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while\nsmaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,\nimplicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and\nquality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.\nOverall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded\nprompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually\nnuanced communication.

    "abstract": "Industrial recommender systems rely on unique Item Identifiers (ItemIDs).\nHowever, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large,\ndynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail data. Content-based Semantic IDs\n(SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However,\nby ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have\nlimited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral\ninformation but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform\ncontent features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,\ncreating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and\nlong-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise\nCorruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative\nnoise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to\nthe loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The\nequal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of\ndifferent behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to\ndistinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we\npropose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,\nDenoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior\nmodalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this\nframework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive\nbehavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield\nrepresentations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical\nsignals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public\nand large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant\nsuperiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.",

Operating on a curated knowledge base\nof over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates\nsuperior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA\nbenchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable\n97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a\nhigh Answer Correctness score of 74.3%.

While significant progress has been made\nin developing advanced and scalable architectures for sequential\nrecommendation(SR) models, there are still challenges due to items'\nmulti-faceted characteristics and dynamic item relevance in the user context.\nTo address these issues, we propose Fuxi-MME, a framework that integrates a\nmulti-embedding strategy with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.\nSpecifically, to efficiently capture diverse item characteristics in a\ndecoupled manner, we decompose the conventional single embedding matrix into\nseveral lower-dimensional embedding matrices.

    "abstract": "In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in\nmodeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring\noptimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent\nresearch follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator\nproduces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In\npractice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.\nHowever, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the\nseparation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,\nautoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we\npropose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address\nthe two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an\nautoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic\nautoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we\npre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter\ninitialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating\nsequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we\npropose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient\nautoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),\nwhich trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items\nwhile preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time\nrecommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF\noutperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is\nnearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also\nbeen deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily\nactive users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.",

    "abstract": "AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external\nknowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not\ninherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that\nMDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP\nframework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.",

StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on\nmodule that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control\nstack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it\ninterfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,\ninterpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that\ncan be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the\nBench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios.

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has\nbeen proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled\nas rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this\napproach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium\nattitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the\nattitude-error Euler axis larger than {\\pi}rad, their proportional-control\neffect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of\nthe CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude\ncontrol law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle\ninformation to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater\nflexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two\ndifferent control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict\nLyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique\nequilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly\nasymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and\nperformance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and\nexecuted dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.\nThese simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed\naxis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that\nobtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of\nstabilization time.",

The proposed approach is validated on five daily\nobjects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that\nthe curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all\nsurfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature\nincreases.

    "abstract": "Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic\nunderstanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This\nwork aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --\nspecifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To\nthis end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the\nenvironment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance\nfields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to\ngenerate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.\nWe then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to\nsynthesize a safe \\textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of\ncaution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The\nsafety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety\nconstraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a\nsemantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of\nenvironmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of\nhigher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how\n\\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated\ninto the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.",

    "abstract": "Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a\nlong-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling\nbetween body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in\nwhich large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical\ndebate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each\nround, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a\ncontrol agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A\npanel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in\nsimulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through\niterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing\nincreasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and\nspecialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a\nquadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther\nthan the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a\npowerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that\nmulti-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising\nnew paradigm for automated robot design.",

State-of-the-art robotic tool usage methods\nfocused on procedurally generating or crowd-sourcing datasets of tools for a\ntask to learn how to grasp and manipulate them for that task. However, these\nmethods assume that only one object is provided and that it is possible, with\nthe correct grasp, to perform the task; they are not capable of identifying,\ngrasping, and using the best object for a task when many are available,\nespecially when the optimal tool is absent. In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a\ntwo-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by\nlearning first to extend the robot's embodiment in simulation and then\ntransferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key\ninsight is that by exploring a robot's embodiment extensions (i.e., building\nnew end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool\ngeometries most beneficial for a task. This learned geometric knowledge can\nthen be distilled to perform generalized tool usage tasks by selecting and\nusing the best available real-world object as tool. On a real robot with 22\ndegrees of freedom (DOFs), GeT-USE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by\n30-60% success rates across three vision-based bimanual mobile manipulation\ntool-usage tasks.",

However, the feasibility of these task-level plans relies on the\ndownward refinability of the abstraction into continuous motion. When a\ndomain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may\nultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in\nslower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement\nissues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches\nonly add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search\neffort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the\ncommon-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to\nidentify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix\nthese failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains\nshow that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and\ndomain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases,\neliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse\nrange of instances from the broader domain.",

Image-based\nquantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor\nspeed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus\nreaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than\nexhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus\nreaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior.

The influence of the moving mass is described in body-frame and\nincluded as states in both an additional kinematic equation and as part of the\ncoupled rigid-body kinetics of the underwater vehicle. The Coriolis-centripetal\neffects are derived from Kirchhoff's equations and the hydrostatics are derived\nusing first principals.

Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated\nvehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around\ncomplex structures or in turbid water.

To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive\nDepth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines\npre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,\nmetric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth\nmap with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with\nour proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves\nimproved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs\nefficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical\nunderwater inspection and intervention.

    "abstract": "Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by\nencoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing\ncomplex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining\nthe shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or\nBox formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.\nWhen more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a\nstatic shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose\na formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost\nfunction while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation\nplanner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative\nrobot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear\nand non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.\nWe theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do\nnot need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized\nusing relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are\nrealized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's\ndirect approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for\nmilitary-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,\nwe show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When\nminimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation\nplanner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning\nprovides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that\nclosely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape\nabstraction.",

    "abstract": "Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:\nconventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire\ndepth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an\nill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with\nelements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication\ncomplexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,\nwe first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around\nwhich we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic\nco-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying\nPoint Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform\nelements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a\nsynthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This\nsimulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction\nnetwork that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity\nAll-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.\nExtensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed\nframework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an\nRMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and\nother deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM\nof 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior\nbalance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that\nthe integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint\nreconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the\nintrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging.

While transferring into\nhand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires\nnot only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along\nthe object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation\nframework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated\nobjects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a\ndiscrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along\nwith the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an\nHAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its\nlanguage description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is\nemployed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated\nobject joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand\nmanipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction\nand HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and\nexperimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation\nperformance comparing with state-of-the-art.

A persistent\nchallenge, however, is maintaining robust target tracking under partial or full\nocclusions. Classical methods like Lucas-Kanade (LK) offer lightweight tracking\nbut are fragile to occlusion and drift, while deep learning-based approaches\noften require continuous visibility and intensive computation. To address these\ngaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced\nperception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher\nconstrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module\noperating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);\nthen, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by\ntexture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a\nthreshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from\nrecent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation,\nrotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz\nimage-based servo loops.

    "abstract": "It's important to monitor road issues such as bumps and potholes to enhance\nsafety and improve road conditions. Smartphones are equipped with various\nbuilt-in sensors that offer a cost-effective and straightforward way to assess\nroad quality. However, progress in this area has been slow due to the lack of\nhigh-quality, standardized datasets. This paper discusses a new dataset created\nby a mobile app that collects sensor data from devices like GPS,\naccelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, gravity sensors, and orientation\nsensors. This dataset is one of the few that integrates Geographic Information\nSystem (GIS) data with weather information and video footage of road\nconditions, providing a comprehensive understanding of road issues with\ngeographic context. The dataset allows for a clearer analysis of road\nconditions by compiling essential data, including vehicle speed, acceleration,\nrotation rates, and magnetic field intensity, along with the visual and spatial\ncontext provided by GIS, weather, and video data. Its goal is to provide\nfunding for initiatives that enhance traffic management, infrastructure\ndevelopment, road safety, and urban planning. Additionally, the dataset will be\npublicly accessible to promote further research and innovation in smart\ntransportation systems.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting visual observations and natural language instructions for\ncomplex task execution remains a key challenge in robotics and AI. Despite\nrecent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly\nfor UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation\n(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to\ngeneralize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The\nemergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,\nenables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,\nthese models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to\nnavigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive\nUAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with\ngeometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image\nannotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A\nhybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM\nreasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant\nrevisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital\ntwin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental\nresults show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by\n25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%. In 3D scenarios, it\nimproves SR by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline.",

To address these\nlimitations, we propose OrderMind, a unified spatial-aware manipulation\nordering framework that directly learns object manipulation priorities based on\nspatial context.

We construct a spatial graph using\nk-Nearest Neighbors to aggregate geometric information from the local layout\nand encode both object-object and object-manipulator interactions to support\naccurate manipulation ordering in real-time. To generate physically and\nsemantically plausible supervision signals, we introduce a spatial prior\nlabeling method that guides a vision-language model to produce reasonable\nmanipulation orders for distillation. We evaluate OrderMind on our Manipulation\nOrdering Benchmark, comprising 163,222 samples of varying difficulty.

However, their deployment on resource-constrained\nedge devices, such as mobile robots or embedded systems (e.g., Jetson Orin\nNano), remains challenging due to high computational demands, especially in\nreal-world scenarios where power, latency, and computational resources are\ncritical. To close this gap, we introduce Nano-scale Vision-Language Action\n(NanoVLA), a family of lightweight VLA architectures that achieve high\nperformance with minimal resources. Our core innovations include: (1)\nvision-language decoupling that moves conventional early vision and language\ninputs fusion in VLM to late stage, achieving better performance while enabling\ncaching and reduce inference overhead and latency; (2) long-short action\nchunking to ensure smooth, coherent multi-step planning without sacrificing\nreal-time responsiveness; (3) dynamic routing that adaptively assigns\nlightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity, further optimizing\ninference efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as\nreal-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster\ninference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models,\nwith 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy\nand generalization.

    "abstract": "Accurate calibration of a Stewart platform is important for their precise and\nefficient operation. However, the calibration of these platforms using forward\nkinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally\ngenerates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving\nplatform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths\nconnecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the\ndifficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.\nThe authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using\nDenavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1\ndeveloped in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based\ncalibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational\nupon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used\ntheir calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted\nthree compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve\nthe accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution\ndigital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving\nplatform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any\nadditional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the\nhexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves\nmultiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position\nand orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The\nTarget poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations\nare estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses.\nResults from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable\nenhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further\nimprovements.",

    "abstract": "The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care\nrobots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on\nhandcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse\nscenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the\nhuman brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which\nunderlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory\nsignals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal\nrecurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the\nfree-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional\nvisuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was\nable to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and\nflexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We\ndemonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent\ndynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,\nand infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through\nvisuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in\nmultitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on\nrepositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest\nreduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.\nAlthough the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish\npredictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,\npointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while\noffering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible\nadaptation in uncertain real-world environments.",

MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG\nevaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information\ncoverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness.

We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three\nprominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the\nlimitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic\nevaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess\nmultimodal RAG.",

    "abstract": "As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes increasingly widespread, the\nrole of information retrieval (IR) is shifting from retrieving information for\nhuman users to retrieving contextual knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI)\nsystems, where relevance becomes difficult to define or annotate beforehand. To\naddress this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG\nthrough trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior\napproaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,\nR3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within\nthe RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the\nenvironment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the\nretriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks\ndemonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original\nretriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving\ncomparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on\npost-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,\nrequiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.",

We present PerFine, a\nunified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization\nthrough iterative, profile-grounded feedback.

The generator then\nrevises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across\niterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as\nBest-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,\nGoodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization\nover PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5\nrefinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size.

Conventional\nrecommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as\nembedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm\nreplaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by\nautoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain\nproprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected\nscaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training\nrecipe that enables competitive performance?\n  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully\nopen-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end\nworkflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and\nrecommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual\nQuantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters\non the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward\ntrend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size,\nvalidating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further\nenhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training\npipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies\nreinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards. Together,\nthese techniques yield significant improvements in both ranking accuracy and\ncandidate diversity.",

Owing to the massive candidate pool and strict latency constraints,\nindustry systems often rely on lightweight two-tower architectures, which are\ncomputationally efficient yet limited in estimation capability. As a result,\nthey struggle to capture the complex synergistic and suppressive relationships\namong candidate items, which are essential for producing contextually coherent\nand diverse recommendation lists. Moreover, this simplicity further amplifies\nthe Sample Selection Bias (SSB) problem, as coarse-grained models trained on\nbiased exposure data must generalize to a much larger candidate space with\ndistinct distributions.\n  To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{DUET} (\\textbf{DU}al Model\nCo-Training for \\textbf{E}ntire Space C\\textbf{T}R Prediction), a set-wise\npre-ranking framework that achieves expressive modeling under tight\ncomputational budgets. Instead of scoring items independently, DUET performs\nset-level prediction over the entire candidate subset in a single forward pass,\nenabling information-aware interactions among candidates while amortizing the\ncomputational cost across the set. Moreover, a dual model co-training mechanism\nextends supervision to unexposed items via mutual pseudo-label refinement,\neffectively mitigating SSB. Validated through extensive offline experiments and\nonline A/B testing, DUET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nand achieves improvements across multiple core business metrics. At present,\nDUET has been fully deployed in Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite Apps, serving the\nmain traffic for hundreds of millions of users.",

    "abstract": "Softening and onboarding computers and controllers is one of the final\nfrontiers in soft robotics towards their robustness and intelligence for\neveryday use. In this regard, embodying soft and physical computing presents\nexciting potential. Physical computing seeks to encode inputs into a mechanical\ncomputing kernel and leverage the internal interactions among this kernel's\nconstituent elements to compute the output. Moreover, such input-to-output\nevolution can be re-programmable. This perspective paper proposes a framework\nfor embodying physical computing into soft robots and discusses three unique\nstrategies in the literature: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing,\nand physical algorithmic computing. These embodied computers enable the soft\nrobot to perform complex behaviors that would otherwise require CMOS-based\nelectronics -- including coordinated locomotion with obstacle avoidance,\npayload weight and orientation classification, and programmable operation based\non logical rules. This paper will detail the working principles of these\nembodied physical computing methods, survey the current state-of-the-art, and\npresent a perspective for future development.",

While many flavors of the TOP exist\nfor planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate\ntoward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the\nrobots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic\nPrize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the\npresence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy\nconstraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and\nstar graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs\nthat coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a\nrank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal\nRank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in\ntemporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious\nOrdinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's\nsenior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and\nsynthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show\nthat 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies\nthat scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the\nglobal index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced\nprize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods.\nFinally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95%\noptimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer\nlinear programming.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained\nrobotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling\nnative temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a\npromising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to\ncomplex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable\nnature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear\noptimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training\non sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited\nsequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging\nits warm-up period.\n  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient\nslope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in\ndeeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,\nwe find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much\nmore pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead\nto a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we\npropose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to\nbootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment\ninteractions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive\nslope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an\naverage return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,\nincluding Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points\nunder the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical\nunderstanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training\nmethodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic\nsystems.",

To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm, Cooperative\nNon-inertial frame-based Obstacle Avoidance (CoNi-OA), designed explicitly for\nUAV-UGV cooperative scenarios without reliance on global state estimation or\nobstacle prediction. CoNi-OA uniquely utilizes a single frame of raw LiDAR data\nfrom the UAV to generate a modulation matrix, which directly adjusts the\nquadrotor's velocity to achieve obstacle avoidance. This modulation-based\nmethod enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the\nUGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less\nthan 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable\nenvironments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a\nmodulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV\ncooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time\ntrajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the\nneed for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static\nand dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or\nunknown scenarios.",

While recent\napproaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised\nrepresentation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms\nsuch as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or\nscene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize\n2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and\ndynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present\nDynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and\ndynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future\nprediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on\nmulti-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future\ndynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned\nrepresentations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic\nmanipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two\nchallenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic\nexperiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate,\ngeneralization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability\nacross diverse manipulation tasks.",

Recently, it has gained\nprominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where\nachieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of\ntasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates\na (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the\ntask's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is\ncompelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that\ncloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its\nfully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg\ninsertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from\nthe Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical\nanalysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with\n$\\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to\nthe demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks.

However,\nsignificant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical\nspaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level\nactions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large\nlanguage models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor\ngeneralization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate\nseamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across\nembodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \\textbf{Boundless Large\nModel (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves\ninstruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and\nsupports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key\ncapabilities -- \\textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and\ncross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I\ninjects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while\nmaintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an\nintent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to\nguide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported\nby a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot\nembodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital\nand physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four\nmodel families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving\n$\\sim\\!\\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\\sim\\!\\textbf{3%}$ in physical\ntasks.",

For fair and rigorous evaluation, we curate GOAT-Core, a\nhigh-quality core split distilled from GOAT-Bench tailored to multi-modal\nopen-vocabulary multi-goal visual navigation. Experimental results show that\nLagMemo's memory module enables effective multi-modal open-vocabulary goal\nlocalization, and that LagMemo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nmulti-goal visual navigation.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a\nsignificant breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ushering in a new era\nof Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). HAI aims to better serve human\nwelfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of\nrobots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex\ntask planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up\nnew pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents\noften lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control\ntasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic\nmanipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical\nworld. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises\na human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an\naction execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a\nvision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task\nperformance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent\nachieves a 28\\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real\nenvironments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly\nimproving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end autonomous driving maps raw sensor inputs directly into\nego-vehicle trajectories to avoid cascading errors from perception modules and\nto leverage rich semantic cues. Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation\nLearning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and\ncovariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is\ntypically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and\nmaps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We\nintroduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory\nScoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs\nwithout losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of\nour knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only\nlearning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data.\nZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive\nPolicy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable\nactions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three\nbenchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop\nplanning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM\n(simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the\nstate-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on\nHUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.",

    "abstract": "The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new\npossibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among\nthese, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to\nidentify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting\nprecise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting\nexample-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images\n(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of\ncapturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To\novercome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that\nunifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide\nembeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a\ncorpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained\nmorphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and\nflexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)\nmosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide\nresearch; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly\nretrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public\npathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including\nanatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,\nand grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and\nstomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional\nimage-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further\ndemonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,\nand enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical\nscenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable\nretrieval solution for digital pathology.",

    "abstract": "The core task of recommender systems is to learn user preferences from\nhistorical user-item interactions. With the rapid development of large language\nmodels (LLMs), recent research has explored leveraging the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs to enhance rating prediction tasks. However, existing\ndistillation-based methods suffer from limitations such as the teacher model's\ninsufficient recommendation capability, costly and static supervision, and\nsuperficial transfer of reasoning ability. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes RecZero, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based recommendation paradigm\nthat abandons the traditional multi-model and multi-stage distillation\napproach. Instead, RecZero trains a single LLM through pure RL to autonomously\ndevelop reasoning capabilities for rating prediction. RecZero consists of two\nkey components: (1) \"Think-before-Recommendation\" prompt construction, which\nemploys a structured reasoning template to guide the model in step-wise\nanalysis of user interests, item features, and user-item compatibility; and (2)\nrule-based reward modeling, which adopts group relative policy optimization\n(GRPO) to compute rewards for reasoning trajectories and optimize the LLM.\nAdditionally, the paper explores a hybrid paradigm, RecOne, which combines\nsupervised fine-tuning with RL, initializing the model with cold-start\nreasoning samples and further optimizing it with RL. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that RecZero and RecOne significantly outperform existing baseline\nmethods on multiple benchmark datasets, validating the superiority of the RL\nparadigm in achieving autonomous reasoning-enhanced recommender systems.",

    "abstract": "Financial documents are essential sources of information for regulators,\nauditors, and financial institutions, particularly for assessing the wealth and\ncompliance of Small and Medium-sized Businesses. However, SMB documents are\noften difficult to parse. They are rarely born digital and instead are\ndistributed as scanned images that are none machine readable. The scans\nthemselves are low in resolution, affected by skew or rotation, and often\ncontain noisy backgrounds. These documents also tend to be heterogeneous,\nmixing narratives, tables, figures, and multilingual content within the same\nreport. Such characteristics pose major challenges for automated information\nextraction, especially when relying on end to end large Vision Language Models,\nwhich are computationally expensive, sensitive to noise, and slow when applied\nto files with hundreds of pages.\n  We propose a multistage pipeline that leverages traditional image processing\nmodels and OCR extraction, together with compact VLMs for structured field\nextraction of large-scale financial documents. Our approach begins with image\npre-processing, including segmentation, orientation detection, and size\nnormalization. Multilingual OCR is then applied to recover page-level text.\nUpon analyzing the text information, pages are retrieved for coherent sections.\nFinally, compact VLMs are operated within these narrowed-down scopes to extract\nstructured financial indicators.\n  Our approach is evaluated using an internal corpus of multi-lingual, scanned\nfinancial documents. The results demonstrate that compact VLMs, together with a\nmultistage pipeline, achieves 8.8 times higher field level accuracy relative to\ndirectly feeding the whole document into large VLMs, only at 0.7 percent of the\nGPU cost and 92.6 percent less end-to-end service latency.",

    "abstract": "Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern\nLocation-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex\ndecision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized\nrecommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI\nrecommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and\nsequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a\nfundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent\nhierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts\nof user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose\nGTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.\nGTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces\nfor different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in\nhyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel\nMamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent\nspace. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses\nspatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),\nenabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on\nthree real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.",

    "abstract": "The powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of large language models\n(LLMs) have inspired researchers to apply them to reasoning-based\nrecommendation tasks, which require in-depth reasoning about user interests and\nthe generation of recommended items. However, previous reasoning-based\nrecommendation methods have typically performed inference within the language\nspace alone, without incorporating the actual item space. This has led to\nover-interpreting user interests and deviating from real items. Towards this\nresearch gap, we propose performing multiple rounds of grounding during\ninference to help the LLM better understand the actual item space, which could\nensure that its reasoning remains aligned with real items. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a user agent that provides feedback during each grounding step,\nenabling the LLM to better recognize and adapt to user interests. Comprehensive\nexperiments conducted on three Amazon review datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of incorporating multiple groundings and feedback. These findings\nunderscore the critical importance of reasoning within the actual item space,\nrather than being confined to the language space, for recommendation tasks.",

    "abstract": "In Taobao e-commerce visual search, user behavior analysis reveals a large\nproportion of no-click requests, suggesting diverse and implicit user intents.\nThese intents are expressed in various forms and are difficult to mine and\ndiscover, thereby leading to the limited adaptability and lag in platform\nstrategies. This greatly restricts users' ability to express diverse intents\nand hinders the scalability of the visual search system. This mismatch between\nuser implicit intent expression and system response defines the User-SearchSys\nIntent Discrepancy. To alleviate the issue, we propose a novel framework\nREVISION. This framework integrates offline reasoning mining with online\ndecision-making and execution, enabling adaptive strategies to solve implicit\nuser demands. In the offline stage, we construct a periodic pipeline to mine\ndiscrepancies from historical no-click requests. Leveraging large models, we\nanalyze implicit intent factors and infer optimal suggestions by jointly\nreasoning over query and product metadata. These inferred suggestions serve as\nactionable insights for refining platform strategies. In the online stage,\nREVISION-R1-3B, trained on the curated offline data, performs holistic analysis\nover query images and associated historical products to generate optimization\nplans and adaptively schedule strategies across the search pipeline. Our\nframework offers a streamlined paradigm for integrating large models with\ntraditional search systems, enabling end-to-end intelligent optimization across\ninformation aggregation and user interaction. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our approach improves the efficiency of implicit intent mining from\nlarge-scale search logs and significantly reduces the no-click rate.",

The planner\nproposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in\ncognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and\nupdate the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action.

Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction\nTuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize\nretrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we\nadopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert\nquestion-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets.

    "abstract": "Users tend to remember failures of a search session more than its many\nsuccesses. This observation has led to work on search robustness, where systems\nare penalized if they perform very poorly on some queries. However, this\nprinciple of robustness has been overlooked within a single query. An ambiguous\nor underspecified query (e.g., ``jaguar'') can have several user intents, where\npopular intents often dominate the ranking, leaving users with minority intents\nunsatisfied. Although the diversification literature has long recognized this\nissue, existing metrics only model the average relevance across intents and\nprovide no robustness guarantees. More surprisingly, we show theoretically and\nempirically that many well-known diversification algorithms are no more robust\nthan a naive, non-diversified algorithm. To address this critical gap, we\npropose to frame diversification as a risk-minimization problem. We introduce\nVRisk, which measures the expected risk faced by the least-served fraction of\nintents in a query. Optimizing VRisk produces a robust ranking, reducing the\nlikelihood of poor user experiences. We then propose VRisker, a fast greedy\nre-ranker with provable approximation guarantees. Finally, experiments on NTCIR\nINTENT-2, TREC Web 2012, and MovieLens show the vulnerability of existing\nmethods. VRisker reduces worst-case intent failures by up to 33% with a minimal\n2% drop in average performance.",
