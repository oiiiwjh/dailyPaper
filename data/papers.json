    "abstract": "In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been\npredominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between\nentities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a\nnovel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair\ndecision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained\nsettings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes.\nOur approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and\nfairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method\ncomputes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual\nadvantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off\nagents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where\nan arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.\n  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing,\nhomelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our\nframework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover\nfar-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by\na theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower\nbound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers\nmonotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled\nframework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve\nmore equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the\nconstrained memory capacity of modern GPUs. To mitigate this,\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of\nparameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and\ncomputational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which\nselect active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable\nlatency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In\naddition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based\non fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and\nworkloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.\n  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE\ninference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.\nExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by\nleveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter\ndimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a\nhybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with\nintermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By\nadaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage\nbehavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency\ncaused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces\nmodel stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability\nto optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.",

    "abstract": "Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a\nscalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless\nmultiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for\ntextual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to\nreason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute\nthis text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction\ntuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal\narchitecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual\nKeys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned\nduring language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive\nsystematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to\ntheir under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this\nhypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their\ndistributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative\n(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that\nvisual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention\nspace. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding\nintra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal\nthat text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key\nspace rather than solely from external data factors.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed\nto advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of\nfoundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are\ntypically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the\nspatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this\nlimitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with\nrich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million\nflights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along\nsequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and\n(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport\nresource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset\nis carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and\nstrict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine\nlearning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including\nregression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,\nserving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph\nmodalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to\nfacilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling\nand general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be\naccessed at https://github.com/Flnny/Delay-data",

At its very core, CSR is about\nfinding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph\nthat have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to\nreason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,\nstronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,\nwe present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow\nmatching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4\ndiverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results\nagainst 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,\ndemonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and\nperceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly\neffective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given\nlow-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that\nResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior\ndistribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,\nenabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can\nguide future users to reject uncertain predictions.",

In\nthis paper, we formalize this challenge as the \\textbf{Reward Density\nOptimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of\nexploration cost. This paper introduce \\textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic\nframework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \\textbf{Subproblem\ndecomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,\nthereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \\textbf{Failure-guided hints}:\ninjecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the\nprobability of successful outcomes. 3) \\textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:\nemploying a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep\nexploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively\ncompresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration\ncost and increasing the overall reward density.

    "abstract": "Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted\nprobabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class\nfrequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong\ncalibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities\nto be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing\napproaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,\nwhich makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of\nthe feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant\nin high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are\nexactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this\nmain shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.\nFirst, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its\nrelationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the\npitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local\ncalibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local\ncalibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted\nprobabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon\ndistance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing\nmulticlass calibration techniques.",

We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer\nlanguage models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to\nquantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results\nshow that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node\nduplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured\nprompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in\nnoisy nodes.

Building on the landmark 61-million-person\nFacebook experiment \\citep{bond201261}, we develop an agent-based simulation\nframework that integrates real U.S. Census demographic distributions, authentic\nTwitter network topology, and heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents\nto examine the effect of mobilization messages on voter turnout. Each simulated\nagent is assigned demographic attributes, a personal political stance, and an\nLLM variant (\\texttt{GPT-4.1}, \\texttt{GPT-4.1-Mini}, or \\texttt{GPT-4.1-Nano})\nreflecting its political sophistication. Agents interact over realistic social\nnetwork structures, receiving personalized feeds and dynamically updating their\nengagement behaviors and voting intentions. Experimental conditions replicate\nthe informational and social mobilization treatments of the original Facebook\nstudy. Across scenarios, the simulator reproduces qualitative patterns observed\nin field experiments, including stronger mobilization effects under social\nmessage treatments and measurable peer spillovers. Our framework provides a\ncontrolled, reproducible environment for testing counterfactual designs and\nsensitivity analyses in political mobilization research, offering a bridge\nbetween high-validity field experiments and flexible computational\nmodeling.\\footnote{Code and data available at\nhttps://github.com/CausalMP/LLM-SocioPol}",

    "abstract": "Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social\nrelations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are\nfundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which\ncontexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,\nprovide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual\nlandscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing\nthese questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context\nengineering and sketch its promising future.

However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on\nQwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks\ndemonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning\ncapabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.",

Based on various real-world videos,\nLoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating\nelements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a\nmulti-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics\nsuch as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content\nclarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on\nmore abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character\ndevelopment. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\nnine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well\non basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event\nconsistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.\nOverall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for\nevaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical\ndirections for future method improvement.",

In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but\noften underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose\nHi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection\nsampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS\nstabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during\nonline fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective\nto provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we\ndevelop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible\nonline human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for\nlearning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two\nembodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich\nmanipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL\nbaselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.\nNotably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by\nreliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better\nperformance.",

To address these challenges, we\npropose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel\ntwo-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation\naccuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior\nnetwork and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse\nlocalization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial\nguidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises\nfour essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric\ncross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to\nexisting segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.",

Current methods for this task operate under a\nmodel-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective\nperformance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a\nitem-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection\nshould be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,\nrather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by\nover 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM\nLeaderboard, using just a 0.5\\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores\nwith a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach\nenables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity\ndegradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more\ninterpretable benchmarking.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining\ncausal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed\ninterventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional\ndata. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We\nevaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating\ninterventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures\nconsistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also\nfacilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be\ncostly to identify.",

    "abstract": "Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from\nsurveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because\nrecovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable\ndownstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed\nto satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual\nrealism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.",

To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated\nCurriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain\nexperts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a\ncomprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for\na subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's\ntaxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing\ndifficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining\nwith an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content\nand cognitive dimensions.\n  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized\nMMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines\nstruggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target\ndomains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage\npoints. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also\nfacilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on\nnon-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on\nknowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,\nwhile maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks.

Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to\nalign semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative\nelements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates.

To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured\ndatasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\\ell_2$-max-margin\nclassifier, in contrast to the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch\nAdam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the\nlimiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\\beta_2 \\to 1$ and we characterize\nits convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.\nFinally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges\nto the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\\beta$\nclose enough to 1.

However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a\nblack-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the\ndiffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate\nsamples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG\nperforms weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according\nto the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling\nstrategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to\nour desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the\nmulti-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood\ninterpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional\nmulti-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective\nmolecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single\ngeneration pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline\noptimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.\nNotably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can\nbe integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.",

    "abstract": "Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving\ntheir general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable\nartificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

    "abstract": "With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is\nessential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone\nto hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may\ncause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection\ntypes present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and\ncross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous\nintersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable\nTSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning\nframework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency\nscenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to\ndistill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the\nreliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this\npaper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a\nReward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3\nadaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with\nenvironment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed\nreward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies\nacross heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17\nto 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC\nreduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle\nwaiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic\nstudies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets\ncapture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique\nchallenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot\nreasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire\ndata or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains\nunderexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,\nSPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such\ndata integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves\nscientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on\nhow to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by\nintroducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a\nbenchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,\nrespondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and\nmultiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing\nan effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%\npoints compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a\nlightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further\nimprovements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and\nprompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile\nfoundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based\nquestionnaire analysis.",

In contrast to\nthe existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential\nprocess where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \\emph{inductive\napproach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.\nThis is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end\nof the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original\ndataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This\nenables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing\nclassification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple\nexperiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using\nCNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).\nExperiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model\nwith a high computational cost reduction.

Current RAG evaluation\nbenchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant\nchunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only\nlocalized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and\nbaselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,\nwith the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that\npreserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates\nLLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates\naggregation modules for precise symbolic computation.

We introduce What's In My Human\nFeedback?

Across 7\ndatasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that\naccount for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by\nblack-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction.

    "abstract": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their\npractical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data,\ncapturing user behaviors, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network\nstructures. Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as\nopinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However,\ndiscovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually\nchallenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization.\nExisting automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language\nmodels (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot\nadequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA\n(Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous\nmulti-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral\ndata), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization\nartifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy\nthat connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques,\nSIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure\nmulti-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies\ntabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive\ninterface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and\nrefine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness.\nThrough expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that\nSIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media\nwhile supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.",

Traditional approaches attempt to model\nthis through multi-objective utility functions, but face fundamental challenges\nin specification and parameterization. We propose a generative framework that\nlearns latent representations of fund manager strategies without requiring\nexplicit utility specification.\n  Our approach directly models the conditional probability of a fund's\nportfolio weights, given stock characteristics, historical returns, previous\nweights, and a latent variable representing the fund's strategy. Unlike methods\nbased on reinforcement learning or imitation learning, which require specified\nrewards or labeled expert objectives, our GAN-based architecture learns\ndirectly from the joint distribution of observed holdings and market data.\n  We validate our framework on a dataset of 1436 U.S. equity mutual funds. The\nlearned representations successfully capture known investment styles, such as\n\"growth\" and \"value,\" while also revealing implicit manager objectives. For\ninstance, we find that while many funds exhibit characteristics of\nMarkowitz-like optimization, they do so with heterogeneous realizations for\nturnover, concentration, and latent factors.\n  To analyze and interpret the end-to-end model, we develop a series of tests\nthat explain the model, and we show that the benchmark's expert labeling are\ncontained in our model's encoding in a linear interpretable way.\n  Our framework provides a data-driven approach for characterizing investment\nstrategies for applications in market simulation, strategy attribution, and\nregulatory oversight.",

Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are\npre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing\nrobustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces\na novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer\nclassification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram\nimages and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view\nsupervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by\nemploying cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes\nmultiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a\nnovel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and\naccuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast\ntissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these\npatterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated\nour method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that\nthe proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three\nclassification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype\nclassification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the\nmodel exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised\nor VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need\nfor actual radiology reports.",

However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily\nfeature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of\nthese systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.",

    "abstract": "Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture\nthe same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce\nEgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized\negocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural\nlanguage. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal\nVerification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but\nconsistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of\nexisting Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with\nresults far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively\nfinetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved\nconsistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For\nimprovements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework\nthat effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging\nconsistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its\nsuperiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view\nconsistency. All resources will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance\nbased on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to\naveraging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate\nsettings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human\ndevelopment and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts\nover Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a\nset of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to\nstratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:\nterritory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or\nwater). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual\nstratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual\ncountry). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of\nstate-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all\nexhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to\nseed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different\nlead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged\nmetrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and\nwhich models are most fair?

    "abstract": "Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and\nhigher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the\npotential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and\ncongestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.",

Existing video-to-4D methods\ntypically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive\nand brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches\nmitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera\ntrajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby\ndepicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this\ntrajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene\ndynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a\npose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory\nprediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby\nseparating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video\ninpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising\nrealistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing\nregions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D\nannotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal\nautoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and\nextends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at\nbounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation\nand sparse reconstruction benchmarks.

In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most\nnotably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization\nin modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can\nleverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework\nthat systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key\npillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that\nintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions\nfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen\nmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed\nfor fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and\ngeneralization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human\nevaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.",

We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

    "abstract": "Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and\nthe exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models\n(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract\nfine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also\nhinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel \"ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)\" to provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting\ntabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various\nattributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON\ntemplate to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically\ntailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference\nworkflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and\ncompare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on\nseveral recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,\nweaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These\nfindings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart\nunderstanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened\nin current models.",

    "abstract": "To address the challenges in UAV object detection, such as complex\nbackgrounds, severe occlusion, dense small objects, and varying lighting\nconditions,this paper proposes PT-DETR based on RT-DETR, a novel detection\nalgorithm specifically designed for small objects in UAV imagery. In the\nbackbone network, we introduce the Partially-Aware Detail Focus (PADF) Module\nto enhance feature extraction for small objects. Additionally,we design the\nMedian-Frequency Feature Fusion (MFFF) module,which effectively improves the\nmodel's ability to capture small-object details and contextual information.\nFurthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box\nmatching capability and increase its sensitivity to small-object features,\nthereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with\nRT-DETR, our PT-DETR achieves mAP improvements of 1.6% and 1.7% on the\nVisDrone2019 dataset with lower computational complexity and fewer parameters,\ndemonstrating its robustness and feasibility for small-object detection tasks.",

Spiking Patches\ngives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show\nin our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate\nour tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and\nobject detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up\nto 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We\nachieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases\nwith absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for\nobject detection.

It stands to\nreason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,\nstronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,\nwe present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow\nmatching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4\ndiverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results\nagainst 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,\ndemonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and\nperceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly\neffective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given\nlow-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that\nResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior\ndistribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,\nenabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can\nguide future users to reject uncertain predictions.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA\nleveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,\ntheir generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain\nscenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to\nlarge distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation\nmechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or\nbespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across\ndiverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for\ncross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while\nrequiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to\ndecouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight\nmodules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual\nadapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a\nVisual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically\ninjected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone\nmodel. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without\nretraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on\nMedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH\nprovides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling\npractical deployment across diverse application domains.",

Firstly,\nthe global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect\nthe high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine\nbones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,\nwhich deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network\n(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a\nscale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional\nlong-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the\nconsistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic\nlevel affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform\nsemantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a\nTransformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a\nfeature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method\nimproves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior\nsegmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on\nQwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks\ndemonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning\ncapabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.",

    "abstract": "Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for\nadapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on\nlabeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt\ncalibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel\nTPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the\ndistribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable\nprompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular\ndistance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate\naverage calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through\nextensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,\nour approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural\ndistribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide\nextensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding\nof A-TPT.

The cross dual encoder network comprises\nfour essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric\ncross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization.

Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ.

To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early\ndetection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently\nestablished based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer\n(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of\nexisting methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One\npotential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of\nbackbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them\n(\\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global\nfeature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to\neffectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the\ntheory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm\ntransforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via\na set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the\naggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively\ntune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the\nperformance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly\navailable DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nhybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability\nfor feature fusion and decision-making.",

Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their\nreal-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework\nintegrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our\nbenchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and\n$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to\n$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity\nsimulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital\ndynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are\nprovided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first\nlarge-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.\nBuilding upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based\nscheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A\ndedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and\noperational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative\nlearning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution\nfor AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that\nAEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy\nefficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each\ncomponent.

Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit\nconstraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the\ngenerated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,\nCATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during\ngeneration, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style.

    "abstract": "Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of\nbalancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images\nby learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain\nlimited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection\nfurther affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex\nscenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion\nunder the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and\nvisible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the\nquantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,\nwhich leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational\nbottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and\ninformation decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal\ninformation, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural\ndetails. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion\nmodel is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical\nguidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at\ndifferent stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the\nintrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nfusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple\ndatasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully\ndemonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing\ninspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and\ndetail quality.",

The management of risks that occur\nin a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the\nsustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the\nsupply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential\nelement in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in\nthe context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed\nto analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to\npropose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric\nnetwork (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This\nnetwork is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to\nderive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the\nproposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The\nSupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction\nof delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The\nproduct classification and edge classification are performed using the\nSupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An\naverage accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk\nmanagement. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for\nsustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4\nproduct relation classification, respectively.

    "abstract": "3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer\nanimation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this\ntask presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature\nof sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of\nlarge-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with\nheuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in\ngeneralizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach\nleveraging a \"learn from synthesis\" strategy. First, a diffusion model is\ntrained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human\nposes, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process\nenables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k\naccurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building\non this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for\nestimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework\ncombines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch\nfeature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose\nestimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee\ngeometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses\nwhile preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and\nsubjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses\nprevious ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.",

    "abstract": "Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is\nrequired to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera\noften uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features\nthat are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as\npeople, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method\ncombining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global\nfeatures that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental\nresults showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the\naccuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times\nhigher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization\nerror of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.\nAdditionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error\non average, which is more accurate than SOTA.",

    "abstract": "Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people\ninteract with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding\nentities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)\nplays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no\ncomprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables\nscenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG\nbenchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse\nset of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn\nconversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to\nmimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to\nreflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of\nimage-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing\ninformation dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:\nsingle-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn\nconversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for\nboth image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that\nstraightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM\nsingle- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry\nsolutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for\nimprovement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K\nparticipants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline\nperformance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.",

    "abstract": "Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical\nlocation and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the\nmost common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,\nrickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto\n(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of\nauto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from\naccessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite\ndifficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially\nnon-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This\npaper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect\nauto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object\ndetection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of\n1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The\nresults show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw\ndetection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values\nabove 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse\ntraffic scenarios.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are\npre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing\nrobustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces\na novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer\nclassification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram\nimages and synthetic radiology reports.

We propose a\nnovel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and\naccuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast\ntissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these\npatterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated\nour method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that\nthe proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three\nclassification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype\nclassification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction.

    "abstract": "Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution\nof video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several\nchallenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and\ncomputational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR\nfor AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency\npriors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation\nunit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a\nsecond-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of\nadjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and\ncontent-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we\ninstantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for\nstrictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a\nlimited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a\nbidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources\nare less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nadaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive\nexperiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods\nin terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference\nspeed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends\nits core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios.

    "abstract": "Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.\nPrevious part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens\noften suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts\nan explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all\nparts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to\ndegraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that\ncombines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding\nbox layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that\nimplicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little\ngeometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed\nfull-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,\neach part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,\nenabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a\ncenter-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when\nexchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby\nmaintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part\ndata, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to\ndate with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation.

However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily\nfeature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of\nthese systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E).

Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.",

OracleAgent\nleverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in\nretrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior\nperformance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,\nsurpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,\nGPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can\neffectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS\nresearch. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the\npractical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture\nthe same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce\nEgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized\negocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural\nlanguage. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal\nVerification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but\nconsistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of\nexisting Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with\nresults far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively\nfinetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved\nconsistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For\nimprovements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework\nthat effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging\nconsistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its\nsuperiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view\nconsistency. All resources will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric\npopulations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound\n(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear\nas cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can\nprovide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly\ntrained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert\nannotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this\nchallenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)\nframework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an\nintra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of\nframes, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate\nvarious image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL\nand introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model\nperformance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation\nstrategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist\nand elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It\noutperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and\nconventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice\ncoefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential\nof FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well\nsuited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.",

This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods.",

    "abstract": "In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been\npredominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between\nentities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the\nalignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which\nmodels learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at\nwhich stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's\npost-training.

Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different\nsizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization\ndatasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a\nmodel's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these\nvalues. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of values, we find that different preference\noptimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when\npreference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into\nhow values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,\nas well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization\nto improve model alignment to human values.",

Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware\nefficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)\ntransition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the\ngeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical\ndelta rule.\n  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total\nparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention\n(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear\noutperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while\nreducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding\nthroughput for a 1M context.

However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the\nlack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation\nfor specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain\nwisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and\nensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as\nimplicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel\nframework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to\nsystematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,\nwithout requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts\ndomain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core\nontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled\nfine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with\nLlama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both\nunmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%\nimprovement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,\nand robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.",

To fill\nthis gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent\nrecipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison\nbetween RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,\npretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\\sim$150M\nto $\\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for\ninstruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling\nscaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall\nmore compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling\nand context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM\nachieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while\nenjoying substantially better inference efficiency.

To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose.

Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and\nconsensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were\ntested for rating the performance of the triage tool.\n  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The\nhighest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).\nThe average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).\nLlama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater\nprecision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the\nideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3\nEnsemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522\n(0.500-0.543).

    "abstract": "Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social\nrelations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are\nfundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which\ncontexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,\nprovide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual\nlandscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing\nthese questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context\nengineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for\na broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number\nof domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these\nmodels often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,\nrequire substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across\ndomains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high\ncomputational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian\nnetwork LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three\nLLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic\nmechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the\nsentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a\nBayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with\ndistinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates\nconsistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,\nunderscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of\nprobabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.",

    "abstract": "Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the\nreasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models\nexplore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on\nQwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks\ndemonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning\ncapabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.",

Code review serves as an effective practice that enables\ndevelopers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.\nTo streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review\napproaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly\nadvanced the capabilities of automated review generation.

To mitigate hallucination in\nLLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG\ntechnique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security\nknowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric\ndesigned to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security\nissues.

In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent\nframework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging\na diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a\nstructured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.\nDuring the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each\nembodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines\nan initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates\na plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed\noracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this\nexecution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using\nthe specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before\nre-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks\ndemonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms\nstate-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle\naccuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The\nimproved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug\ndetection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases\nfrom 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of\nautomated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.",

Additionally, current benchmarks are often\nlimited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.\nThis issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address\nthis gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational\nbenchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.\nThe data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge\ndimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K\nentries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained\ncategories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and\n20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of\nquestion formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid\nfoundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.\nExtensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs\nreveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro\nsurpassed 60\\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the\nbest-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\\%.\nThese results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the\nchallenges of applying LLMs in education.",

    "abstract": "OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,\nenabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute\ncursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for\ninformation retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,\ninteractive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an\nearly evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based\ngames as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,\nand Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics\nto assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas\nperforms strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles\nsignificantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in\nreal-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to\nprogress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas\ndemonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in\ndynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction.

However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external\noutputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these\nsignals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze\ninternal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)\nexternal signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;\n(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than\nincorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct\nresponses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones\ndiverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding\n(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using\nactivation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on\ninternal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables\nearly correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports\naggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable\nanswers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where\nmajority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By\npruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with\nminimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide\nreliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.",

However, current watermarking solutions hardly\nresolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself\nfaithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the\nsecret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or\nthe adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be\nprivate, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the\ndilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),\nenabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third\nparties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of\n`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints\nare built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and\nsummation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,\ncovering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and\nfour ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of\ncircumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public\nverifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without\ncompromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in\npractice.",

Current RAG evaluation\nbenchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant\nchunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only\nlocalized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and\nbaselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,\nwith the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that\npreserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates\nLLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates\naggregation modules for precise symbolic computation.

These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction.

    "abstract": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their\npractical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative\napplications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model\narchitectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or\nstate-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing\nSSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially\nlimiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel\nmixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head\nattention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation\nnot only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in\nthe time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple \"attention heads.\" Extensive\nexperiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet\noutperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size\nand data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,\nfurther confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,\nreal-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU\ndemonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly\nsized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction\nfor efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.",

The\nsilver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on\nthe majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver\ndatasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,\nCause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive\ntexts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,\nRepetition and to cast Doubt.

    "abstract": "While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning\nability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often\nbecomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common \"one problem, one\nsolution\" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer\nand can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we\npropose a \"one problem, multiple solutions\" (1PNS) training paradigm that\nexposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus\nincreases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring\nsemantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce\nReasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores\nLong Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate\nreasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and\nfine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields\nmore varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16\nover a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that\n1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS.

First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator\nenvironment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of\ndomain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error\nclassification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it\nincorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming\ncontests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of\nLLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even\nadvanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting\nthe difficulty of the benchmark.

However, its effect on model's\nrobustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on\nout-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods.",

Objective To develop, validate, and\ndeploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in\nradiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior\nthyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from\nJuly 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline\nidentified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from\nmultiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of\nITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer\ndiagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related\nfactors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%\nwomen), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more\nlikely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was\nordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were\nmore likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule\ncharacteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other\nfeatures in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients\nwithout ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,\nbiopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were\npapillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were\ncommon and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,\nlow-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer\noverdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective\nfollow-up.",

    "abstract": "There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation\nand 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a\npromising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce\nimmersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance\nthis technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically\nbased rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to\nrepurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,\nand PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize\nappearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we\npresent OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and\nefficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for\na broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,\ngeneration, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic\npanorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse\nindoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene\ngeneration, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic\nvirtual world generation.",

    "abstract": "Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale\nremains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global\nclassification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while\ncross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain\ngap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a\nhybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large\ngeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification\ntask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly\nencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with\nembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of\nground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas\nspanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach can localize within 200m more than 68\\% of queries of a dataset\ncovering a large part of Europe.

PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty\nover linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise\nshifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that\nTransformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on\nunseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published\nclassical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up\nto $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.\nSurprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can\nbe reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented\ntogether during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying\nstructures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with\nmodulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for\nnear-perfect prediction grows as $\\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization\nenters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \\geq\n2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating\na critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding\nlayers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously\ngroups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,\nrevealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric.

There are two major\napproaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)\napproach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a\nclassification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population\nwelfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by\nmaximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on\nregression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect\n(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.\nThis study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are\nbased on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an\nexact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of\nthe policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in\nseveral respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common\nconditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization\nmethod for policy learning.

Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station.

LSM-MS2\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in spectral identification, improving on\nexisting methods by 30% in accuracy of identifying challenging isomeric\ncompounds, yielding 42% more correct identifications in complex biological\nsamples, and maintaining robustness under low-concentration conditions.\nFurthermore, LSM-MS2 produces rich spectral embeddings that enable direct\nbiological interpretation from minimal downstream data, successfully\ndifferentiating disease states and predicting clinical outcomes across diverse\ntranslational applications.",

Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the\nalignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which\nmodels learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at\nwhich stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's\npost-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training\nalgorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts\nduring training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different\nsizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization\ndatasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a\nmodel's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these\nvalues. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of values, we find that different preference\noptimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when\npreference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into\nhow values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,\nas well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization\nto improve model alignment to human values.",

This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary\nexpert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral\nframework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing\nexpert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both\ntwo-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively\nquery only a subset of experts per training example.

We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our\nalgorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.\nEmpirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially\nreduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating\nthe practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.",

Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware\nefficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)\ntransition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the\ngeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical\ndelta rule.\n  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total\nparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention\n(MLA).

    "abstract": "In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain\ndistribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment\nconditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level\nobservations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely\non key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful\nlearning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de\nfacto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action\nthat results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an\nenergy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world\nsystems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit\nnon-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this\npaper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is\ncapable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in\nstark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is\nconstructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.\nWe showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single\ncells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate\nvelocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better\nmatch both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands\nflow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the\nmodeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems.

Therefore, the only scalable and viable\nsolution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected\nfrom diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,\nbased on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to\nrun. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to\ntime series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based\napproaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper\nstudies the performance of time series classification methods used as model\nselection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations\nderived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we\npropose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series\nclassification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results\ndemonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly\ndetection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution\ntime. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and\nefficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and\nrepresents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection\nstep in general AutoML pipelines.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is\nbecoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often\nignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.\nTo overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the\nparameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the\nminimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance\nbetween the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which\ntakes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based\noptimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed\nmethod provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein\ndistance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced\nnonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than\nor comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,\nwhile maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via\ncontrol points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that\ncombines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.\nProspects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian\ndistributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and\nadapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating\nsurfaces and more complex structures.",

Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong\ncalibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities\nto be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing\napproaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,\nwhich makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of\nthe feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant\nin high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are\nexactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this\nmain shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.\nFirst, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its\nrelationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the\npitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local\ncalibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local\ncalibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted\nprobabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon\ndistance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing\nmulticlass calibration techniques.",

In this work, we present a\ncompression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for\nlightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for\ntraining compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory\nfootprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and\nthresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models\nachieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to\nLightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory\nlayout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently\nof constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,\nrequiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the\ndoor to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge\nanalytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited\nenvironments.",

Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse\nkinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions\nusing tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action\ntrajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired\nskills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive\nexperimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver\ndemonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our\ntrained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our\nmodel achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two\ndistinct tools of different lengths.

We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer\nlanguage models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

    "abstract": "The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of\napplications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely\nadopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,\nhigh-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first\nvalidated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly\noutperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of\npredicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from\ntube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the\nstaged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,\npotentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.",

Our framework supports both standalone\nimplementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to\naccelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model\nfamilies demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from\n$3.31\\times$ to $4.01\\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \\times$ for\nLLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \\times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \\times$ for\nQwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution.

    "abstract": "Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the\nreasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models\nexplore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on\nQwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks\ndemonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning\ncapabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.",

Current methods for this task operate under a\nmodel-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective\nperformance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a\nitem-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection\nshould be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,\nrather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by\nover 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM\nLeaderboard, using just a 0.5\\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores\nwith a 2.9% mean absolute error.

    "abstract": "Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal\npredictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate\nand efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,\ninitialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.\nWhile data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the\ncomplex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic\nforecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow\nMatching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful\nprobabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric\ncirculation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast\nskillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20\ndays in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is\ncomparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes\nfor a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging\nFM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that\nSSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,\ndistinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by\ninternal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally\nefficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and\nshowcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of\natmosphere-climate dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model\ntraining across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling\nprivacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.\nHowever, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally\ndifferent neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain\nscarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to\nsupport architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate\nvariants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),\nstill presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate\nfederations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,\nCNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical\nheterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each\nclient's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,\nundermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,\nhave non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,\ncurrent methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose\nUnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous\nlocal networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a\nshared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to\nparameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean\ndistances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy\nbalancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and\nhippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior\nperformance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL",

    "abstract": "Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining\ncausal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed\ninterventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional\ndata. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We\nevaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating\ninterventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures\nconsistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also\nfacilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be\ncostly to identify.",

First, we validate our approach in a\ncontrolled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of\nthe known $\\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5\ndegree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further\nreduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that\nlack physical insight.

Prior analyses show that Adam\nfavors solutions aligned with $\\ell_\\infty$-geometry, but these results are\nrestricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias\nof incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on\nlinearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the\nfull-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured\ndatasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\\ell_2$-max-margin\nclassifier, in contrast to the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch\nAdam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the\nlimiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\\beta_2 \\to 1$ and we characterize\nits convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.\nFinally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges\nto the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\\beta$\nclose enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of\nAdam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while\nSignum remains invariant.",

    "abstract": "Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in\napplications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and\nrecommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are\nlimited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,\nreal-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.\nFor example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses\ndifferently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying\nsimilarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under\nscenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling\nthe imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are\nunderrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering\nof Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets\nfrom multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize\nutility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose\nOff-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on\noffline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that\nexplicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the\nsecond challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting\nwith active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited\nnumber of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster\nstructure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,\nA$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative\ndimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively\ncollected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we\nvalidate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets.",

Existing approaches often\nemploy an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the\ndiffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a\nblack-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the\ndiffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate\nsamples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG\nperforms weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according\nto the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling\nstrategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to\nour desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the\nmulti-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood\ninterpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional\nmulti-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective\nmolecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single\ngeneration pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline\noptimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.\nNotably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can\nbe integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.",

To resolve the\ndilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),\nenabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third\nparties without disclosing any secret key.

Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

The\nrate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of\nhealthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine\nlearning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical\nfactors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the\nhealth claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component\nAnalysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building\nregression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area\nUnder Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance\nfollowed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models\ncan be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help\nidentify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately\nbringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the\npatients.",

Despite\nthe progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or\nitems to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in\nreal-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and\nmodel-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying\nmulti-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows\nthat naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several\ndomain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained\nsolely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first\nexperimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based\ncross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we\nintroduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and\ntarget domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging.\nWeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not\nintroduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory.\nFurthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the\nupper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments\non single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation\nscenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation\nand consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation\ntasks.",

To further optimize ranking performance, we introduce a hybrid loss\nfunction that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a cosine\nsimilarity term and robust negative sampling, ensuring explicit negative\nfeedback is distinguished from unobserved data. Experiments on the MovieLens\n100k and 1M datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art\nbaselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP while demonstrating robustness for users\nwith limited interaction history. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of\nLLM-augmented embeddings and the cosine similarity term in capturing nuanced\nsemantic relationships. Our approach effectively mitigates sparsity and\ncold-start limitations by integrating LLM-derived contextual understanding into\ngraph-based architectures. Future directions include balancing recommendation\naccuracy with coverage and diversity, and introducing fairness-aware\nconstraints and interpretability features to enhance system performance\nfurther.",

    "abstract": "Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require\na regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to\nalign semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative\nelements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate\ncontributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured\nrepresentations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a cornerstone of real-world legal decision\nmaking, as it enables practitioners to identify precedents for a given query\ncase. Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and\npretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are\nrich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the\ncrucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can\nlead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the\ndistinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another,\nmirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such\ninformation into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy\nof case retrieval.

However, these efforts typically proceed on separate\ntracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also\nprevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans,\na unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior\nsequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer\nto convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token\nsequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar\nsequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential\ntokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables\nprecomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly\nreducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental\nresults on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales\nefficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.",

However,\napproaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to\njointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short\nstochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step\nconsistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump\ngeneration, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a\ntrajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a\ndenoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and\non a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step\nDDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing\nlatency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow\ninference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a\npractical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.",

    "abstract": "In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain\ndistribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment\nconditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.",

    "abstract": "We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,\nspecifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and\nspatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that\npreserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as\nvoxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames\nand voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches\ngives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show\nin our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate\nour tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and\nobject detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up\nto 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We\nachieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases\nwith absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for\nobject detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in\nevent-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the\nproperties of event cameras.",

    "abstract": "Visual navigation algorithms for quadrotors often exhibit a large variation\nin performance when transferred across different vehicle platforms and scene\ngeometries, which increases the cost and risk of field deployment. To support\nsystematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,\nconfigurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and\nscenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models\nvehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:\nmaximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The\nbenchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and\nvirtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together\nwith a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform\nimportance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare\nrepresentative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches\nunder identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario\ncombination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal\nsystematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform\ncapability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct\npreferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These\nobservations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform\ncapability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and\nselection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across\ndiverse platforms and scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and\nembodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,\nscalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing\napproaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical\nframeworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent\nmemory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long\nhorizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting\nthe need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,\nand robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel\nSpatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene\ngeometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared\nrepresentation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a\nbrain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global\nplanning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute\nactions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution\nenables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent\nstate synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex\ncoordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results\ndemonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous\nembodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and\nrobust multi-robot collaboration.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic\nmanipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with\nRL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at\nintermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but\noften underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose\nHi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection\nsampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS\nstabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during\nonline fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective\nto provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we\ndevelop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible\nonline human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for\nlearning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two\nembodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich\nmanipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL\nbaselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.\nNotably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by\nreliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue\napplications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while\nperforming intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,\nenabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such\nconditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a\nhumanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich\nenvironments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive\ntorso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like\nresponses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional\nchallenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning\narchitecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each\ncomponent shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its\nparameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially\noutperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot\nachieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body\nweight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing\nimprovements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the\nbest-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack\n(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N).

    "abstract": "Motion imitation is a promising approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling\nagents to acquire humanlike behaviors. Existing methods typically rely on\nhigh-quality motion capture datasets such as AMASS, but these are scarce and\nexpensive, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent studies attempt to scale\ndata collection by converting large-scale internet videos, exemplified by\nHumanoid-X. However, they often introduce physical artifacts such as floating,\npenetration, and foot skating, which hinder stable imitation. In response, we\nintroduce PHUMA, a Physically-grounded HUMAnoid locomotion dataset that\nleverages human video at scale, while addressing physical artifacts through\ncareful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. PHUMA enforces joint\nlimits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating, producing motions\nthat are both large-scale and physically reliable. We evaluated PHUMA in two\nsets of conditions: (i) imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded test\nvideos and (ii) path following with pelvis-only guidance. In both cases,\nPHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS, achieving significant\ngains in imitating diverse motions. The code is available at\nhttps://davian-robotics.github.io/PHUMA.",

Self-localization based on a camera\noften uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features\nthat are calculated by nearby pixels.

This study proposes a new method\ncombining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global\nfeatures that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental\nresults showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the\naccuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times\nhigher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization\nerror of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.\nAdditionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error\non average, which is more accurate than SOTA.",

To address this issue, we propose the adaptive\ntrajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to\nensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision\ntest is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively\nsubdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee\npose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line\nsearch is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free\nand maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x\nfaster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper,\nwe discuss EI as a design principle for advanced microrobotics, with a\nparticular focus on co-design -- the simultaneous and interdependent\ndevelopment of physical structure and behavioral function. To illustrate the\ncontrast between EI-inspired systems and traditional architectures that\ndecouple sensing, computation, and actuation, we present and discuss a\ncollection of robots developed by the author and his team at the Autonomous\nMicrorobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL). These robots exhibit intelligent\nbehavior that emerges from their structural dynamics and the physical\ninteraction between their components and with the environment. Platforms such\nas the Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, and FRISSHBot\nexemplify how feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart\nactuation strategies can be embedded into the physical properties of the\nrobotic system itself. Along these lines, we contend that co-design is not only\na method for empirical optimization under constraints, but also an enabler of\nEI, offering a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for\nrobotics at the mm-to-cm-scale.",

Our research investigates how different\nlevels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,\nextending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories\ninto a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view\nvideos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),\nor high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we\ntriangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and\nuncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and\nqualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.",

In this work, we conduct an empirical study to\ncomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular\nVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including\nspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically\ncharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,\nwe curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables\nin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our\nfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning\npatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and\nlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal\nreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are\nnot yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging\nsigns as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\nProject page: https://video-cof.github.io",

Using causal mediation analysis on\na diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of\nattention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of\nthe filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate\nthat this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted\nand reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,\npresented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also\nidentify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for\nfiltering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing\nthis intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations.

    "abstract": "A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.\nGiven past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the\nembodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.",

    "abstract": "As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how\nto retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns\nwhen to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety\nviolations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for\nmaking misaligned models safer after deployment.",

Two complementary strategies were explored:\n(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)\nfoundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants\nthrough prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the\nSAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1\nb+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on\nthe small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize\noverfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,\nand a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was\napplied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve\ngeneralization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300\nepochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently\napplied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time\naugmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible\nperformance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice\nSimilarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the\nhidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall\nin the TrackRAD2025 challenge.

Despite recent progress\nenabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the\nactual seen images. We present \"Brain-IT\", a brain-inspired approach that\naddresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),\nallowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar\nbrain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as\nbuilding blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All\nmodel components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient\ntraining with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT\npredicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level\nsemantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic\ncontent of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to\ninitialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.\nBIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to\nlocalized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image\nreconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and\nsurpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective\nmetrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve\nresults comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.",

    "abstract": "Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due\nto their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their\nstrong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing\ntasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the\nlatent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in\noutputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have\nattempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based\napproaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal\nediting quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation\nframework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target\nvelocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct\ndirections, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final\nedited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and\nattribute disentanglement.

Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on\noptimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision\nor on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric\napproximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D\ngeneration of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with\nthe advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending\nthese methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models\nposes significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a\ntraining-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of\ntraining a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a\npre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape\nprior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by\ntreating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images\ncaptured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the\nobject's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring\ntask-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our\nmethod generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts\nunderlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object\ncategories.

Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,\nand ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.\nAblation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank\nsetting.

    "abstract": "Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread\nattention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base\nmodels, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE\nachieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o\nconfirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.",

In this\nstudy, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver\ntumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+\nwith various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and\nState-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.\nSurprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models\nconsistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across\nmultiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we\nintroduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating\nthe Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.\nResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a\nDice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise\nboundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The\nmodel's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of\n0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately\nidentifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance\ninterpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the\nregion's most influential predictions, providing insights into its\ndecision-making process.

Its parameter\nefficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where\nboth communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,\nglobal prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,\nwhile personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We\npropose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt\nTuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and\npersonalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs.

For each\ninput, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived\nfrom global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables\nper-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable\nparameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated\naveraging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,\nTinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT\nconsistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data\nheterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and\ngeneralizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.",

To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences\nwhile maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action\nRecognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D\nAction Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims\nto proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,\nhas been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample\nselection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to\nembed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,\ncombined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,\nis utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for\nannotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not\nnecessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may\nhave already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.\nTo solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active\nlearning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an\ninformative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of\nskeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of\nthe factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from\nEuclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning\nstrategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.\nExtensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.",

However, prior work often overlooks the tight\ncoupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex\ninter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device\nmulti-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.\nInstead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire\ninference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,\nallowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also\nintroduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that\ncaptures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain\naccuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for\nfine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during\ninference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and\ninput data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration\noptimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for\neach modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping\nmechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early\npredictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public\nmultimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-based multimodal testbed.

In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing\na holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which\nquantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.\nUsing this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they\nconsistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural\nlocalization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the\ninternal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal\nfactual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at\ndifferent model layers.

In this work, we\npropose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a\ntool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.\nSpecifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given\nquery, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a\ntree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability\nto produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step\nacross different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps\nunder the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards\nare used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with\ntrajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments\nutilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and\ntime-invariant topics.

To address\nthis gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that\nreformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical \"actions\".

This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all\nrollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert\ndemonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging\nproblems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training\nwith SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.\nBeyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software\nengineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework\nfor reasoning-oriented LLMs.",

Our study\nchallenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find\nthat combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the\nin-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a\nsufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we\nobserve that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language\nthat serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits\nacross language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot\nlanguage from within a specific family does not consistently improve\nperformance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a\nsignificant \"curse of multilinguality\" as the number of training languages\nincreases in models at this scale.

    "abstract": "The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute\nhuman labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.\nNonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,\ncomprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of\nannotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still\nmissing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an\nextensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic\nannotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology\nemployed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental\nsettings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that\nthe hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame\ndiversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only\nsetting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all\nmetrics, except for annotation time.",

However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when\nhuman judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking\ntraces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging\nto collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer\nthinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a\nsimple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at\nscale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:\n(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation\nguidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods\nlead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined\nannotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These\nresults suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise\nunrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended\ninto thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM\nraters.",

Although diagrams\nare presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce\nclear diagrams with well-defined structure.

In this paper, we propose\nDiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration\ndiagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams\nas graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed\nedges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node\nalignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate\ndiagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,\nquantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show\nhow the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable\ninsights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams.

However, existing\nlanguage agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks\nthat lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to\nevaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the\nTool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering\ndiverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable\nexecution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604\ntools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to\nprofessional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools\nare based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we\nmay have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily\nensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we\nprovide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas\ncourses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark\nincludes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting\nwith multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete.

    "abstract": "Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their\ntask generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the\ncurrent LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including\nthe high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data\nscales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key\nresearch question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of\ndata-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a\ntaxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,\ndata quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and\ncompression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative\napproaches in each category and outline future research directions. By\nexamining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open\nproblems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires\nfurther exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in\nlarge-scale model training. Paper List:\nhttps://github.com/luo-junyu/Awesome-Data-Efficient-LLM",

We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data\ninto understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.\nWe first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for\nunderstanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,\nforming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation\nsample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a\nretrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired\nstructures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent\npolicy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware\nvariant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity\nscore to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from\nwell-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality\ndataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on\nthe powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on\nvarious UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines.

The encoder uses masked spectral\npretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal\nalignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens.\nTo reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated\nselective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is\nregistered and bound into the proof.

Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a\ngateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates\nwith differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization\nwithout weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are\npart of each public statement.

Despite\nrecent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their\nability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of\nEHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,\nspecifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning\ninstruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M\nnon-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a\nthinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning\ndata at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced\nLLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage\ntraining paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and\nreinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and\ndiverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.\nLastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning\n42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR\nscenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including\nDeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and\nachieving a 10\\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT.

We propose a framework for\nassessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,\nintroducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as\ngenerated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic\nprogram. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids\nunnecessary inference.

FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting\nprocess: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence\nsufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,\nprogressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base\nof over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates\nsuperior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA\nbenchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable\n97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a\nhigh Answer Correctness score of 74.3%.

This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially\nrespond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal.\nOne under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality,\nencompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation\ntypes are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and\nsocial meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely\nrely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to\nfailure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic\nfeatures influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through\nopen-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether\nmodel behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce\na new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality,\ndesigned to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice.

The PQC is unitary by construction,\nmaking the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.\nAt each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding\nand processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical\nnonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state\nvia unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it\nunifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial\nobservation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control\nfor input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with\nup to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,\nand language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to\nobtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum\nmemory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit\nreadouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine\ntranslation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)\ngrounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against\nstrong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.",

TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona\n(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and\nNarrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation\nof LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion\nconsistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,\nand syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models\nachieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of\ncapabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the\naverage performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human\nbaseline.",

Current paradigms either myopically\noptimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,\ncreating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce\n\\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and\ndeploying proactive dialogue agents \\textit{directly from offline expert data},\nbypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to\nreframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \\textbf{observed\nfuture} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,\nturn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,\ndecomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised\nlearning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action,\nstate_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,\n\\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader\nCalibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward\nmodel with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy\nof \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying\nsizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs\ninto a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,\nour model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,\nproving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,\nreal-world impact.

To\naddress this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first\ngenerates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then\nperforms auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and\ninformative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a\nsequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs\nconvey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture\nthe redundancy across consecutive AD outputs.

To address this gap, we\ninvestigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing\nsix metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one\nhand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA\nzero-shot direct assessment on the other hand.

Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and\ndemonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic\nequivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias\ntoward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to\ndetect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and\nLLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases.

Content-based Semantic IDs\n(SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However,\nby ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have\nlimited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral\ninformation but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform\ncontent features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,\ncreating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and\nlong-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise\nCorruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative\nnoise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to\nthe loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The\nequal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of\ndifferent behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to\ndistinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we\npropose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,\nDenoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior\nmodalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this\nframework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive\nbehavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield\nrepresentations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical\nsignals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public\nand large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant\nsuperiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.",

Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA\nbenchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable\n97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a\nhigh Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for\nPersian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is\ncrucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.",

    "abstract": "Query rewriting is a fundamental technique in information retrieval (IR). It\ntypically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the\nquery and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and\nrelevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its\nvector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging\ntop-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed\nbased on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are\nrelevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed\nspecifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language\nmodels (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free\nquery reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again,\nrelies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting\nquality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed\nframework: \\textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which\nperforms model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents,\nnot only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the\nrelevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training\npipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy\nfeedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers\ndemonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing\nit as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.",

By replacing\nboth fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec\nachieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction\npatterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for\nself-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.\nExtensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.",

    "abstract": "In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in\nmodeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring\noptimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent\nresearch follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator\nproduces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In\npractice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.\nHowever, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the\nseparation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,\nautoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we\npropose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address\nthe two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an\nautoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic\nautoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we\npre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter\ninitialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating\nsequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we\npropose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient\nautoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),\nwhich trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items\nwhile preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time\nrecommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF\noutperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is\nnearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also\nbeen deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily\nactive users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.",

    "abstract": "AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external\nknowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not\ninherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that\nMDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP\nframework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.",

This paper introduces\nStuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that\nenables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or\npassenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on\nmodule that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control\nstack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it\ninterfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,\ninterpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that\ncan be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the\nBench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios.

In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS\ndetected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local\ntransportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion\npropagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and\nenable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.\nCrucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on\nfrequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and\ncost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.\nThis study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated\nreal-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for\nthe operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation\nmanagement.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has\nbeen proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled\nas rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this\napproach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium\nattitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the\nattitude-error Euler axis larger than {\\pi}rad, their proportional-control\neffect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of\nthe CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude\ncontrol law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle\ninformation to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater\nflexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two\ndifferent control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict\nLyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique\nequilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly\nasymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and\nperformance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and\nexecuted dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.\nThese simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed\naxis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that\nobtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of\nstabilization time.",

    "abstract": "Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications\nsuch as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive\ndevices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However,\nmost existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their\naccuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This\nlimitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this\nchallenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile\nsensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved\nsurfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict\nlocal curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,\nachieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily\nobjects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that\nthe curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all\nsurfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature\nincreases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the\naccuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling\ndependable performance across real-world applications.",

This\nwork aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --\nspecifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To\nthis end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the\nenvironment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance\nfields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to\ngenerate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.\nWe then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to\nsynthesize a safe \\textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of\ncaution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The\nsafety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety\nconstraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a\nsemantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of\nenvironmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of\nhigher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how\n\\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated\ninto the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.",

    "abstract": "Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a\nlong-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling\nbetween body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in\nwhich large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical\ndebate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each\nround, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a\ncontrol agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A\npanel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in\nsimulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through\niterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing\nincreasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and\nspecialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a\nquadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther\nthan the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a\npowerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that\nmulti-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising\nnew paradigm for automated robot design.",

State-of-the-art robotic tool usage methods\nfocused on procedurally generating or crowd-sourcing datasets of tools for a\ntask to learn how to grasp and manipulate them for that task. However, these\nmethods assume that only one object is provided and that it is possible, with\nthe correct grasp, to perform the task; they are not capable of identifying,\ngrasping, and using the best object for a task when many are available,\nespecially when the optimal tool is absent. In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a\ntwo-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by\nlearning first to extend the robot's embodiment in simulation and then\ntransferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key\ninsight is that by exploring a robot's embodiment extensions (i.e., building\nnew end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool\ngeometries most beneficial for a task. This learned geometric knowledge can\nthen be distilled to perform generalized tool usage tasks by selecting and\nusing the best available real-world object as tool.

    "abstract": "The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the\npromise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with\ntransferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a\nfoundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs\nare adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their\noriginal VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,\nshowing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual\nrepresentations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's\nhidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of\ntargeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart\nVLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We\nfurther evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and\nintroduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields\nimproved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,\nour analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the\ndegradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to\nrecover inherited VL capabilities.

Each agent is\nassigned a social awareness index that quantifies its level of cooperation or\nself-interest, allowing heterogeneous social behaviors within the system.\nBuilding on the spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework, we propose a real-time STT\nframework that synthesizes tubes online for each agent while capturing its\nsocial interactions with others. A closed-form, approximation-free control law\nis derived to ensure that each agent remains within its evolving STT, thereby\navoiding dynamic obstacles while also preventing inter-agent collisions in a\nsocially aware manner, and reaching the target within a prescribed time.

    "abstract": "In task and motion planning, high-level task planning is done over an\nabstraction of the world to enable efficient search in long-horizon robotics\nproblems. However, the feasibility of these task-level plans relies on the\ndownward refinability of the abstraction into continuous motion. When a\ndomain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may\nultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in\nslower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement\nissues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches\nonly add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search\neffort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the\ncommon-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to\nidentify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix\nthese failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains\nshow that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and\ndomain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases,\neliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse\nrange of instances from the broader domain.",

Image-based\nquantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor\nspeed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus\nreaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than\nexhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus\nreaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of\npropagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding\nmedium in forming octopus-like reaching motion.

    "abstract": "Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by\nencoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing\ncomplex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining\nthe shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or\nBox formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.\nWhen more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a\nstatic shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose\na formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost\nfunction while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation\nplanner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative\nrobot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear\nand non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.\nWe theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do\nnot need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized\nusing relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are\nrealized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's\ndirect approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for\nmilitary-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,\nwe show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When\nminimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation\nplanner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning\nprovides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that\nclosely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape\nabstraction.",

While deep optics with\nelements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication\ncomplexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,\nwe first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around\nwhich we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic\nco-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying\nPoint Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform\nelements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a\nsynthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This\nsimulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction\nnetwork that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity\nAll-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.\nExtensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed\nframework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an\nRMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and\nother deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM\nof 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior\nbalance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that\nthe integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint\nreconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the\nintrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging.

    "abstract": "Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic\nthat benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into\nhand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires\nnot only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along\nthe object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation\nframework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated\nobjects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a\ndiscrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along\nwith the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an\nHAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its\nlanguage description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is\nemployed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated\nobject joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand\nmanipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction\nand HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and\nexperimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation\nperformance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp\napplication that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning\nusing the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets\nwill be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Vision-based control systems, such as image-based visual servoing (IBVS),\nhave been extensively explored for precise robot manipulation. A persistent\nchallenge, however, is maintaining robust target tracking under partial or full\nocclusions. Classical methods like Lucas-Kanade (LK) offer lightweight tracking\nbut are fragile to occlusion and drift, while deep learning-based approaches\noften require continuous visibility and intensive computation. To address these\ngaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced\nperception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher\nconstrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module\noperating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);\nthen, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by\ntexture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a\nthreshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from\nrecent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation,\nrotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz\nimage-based servo loops. Evaluated on handheld video sequences with up to 90%\nocclusion, our system sustains under 2px tracking error, demonstrating the\nrobustness and low-latency precision essential for reliable real-world robot\nvision applications.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting visual observations and natural language instructions for\ncomplex task execution remains a key challenge in robotics and AI. Despite\nrecent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly\nfor UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation\n(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to\ngeneralize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The\nemergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,\nenables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,\nthese models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to\nnavigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive\nUAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with\ngeometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image\nannotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A\nhybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM\nreasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant\nrevisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital\ntwin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental\nresults show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by\n25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%. In 3D scenarios, it\nimproves SR by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline.",

Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as\nreal-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster\ninference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models,\nwith 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy\nand generalization.

However, the calibration of these platforms using forward\nkinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally\ngenerates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving\nplatform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths\nconnecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the\ndifficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.\nThe authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using\nDenavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1\ndeveloped in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based\ncalibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational\nupon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used\ntheir calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted\nthree compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve\nthe accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution\ndigital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving\nplatform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any\nadditional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the\nhexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves\nmultiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position\nand orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The\nTarget poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations\nare estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses.\nResults from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable\nenhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further\nimprovements.",

    "abstract": "The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care\nrobots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on\nhandcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse\nscenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the\nhuman brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which\nunderlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory\nsignals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal\nrecurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the\nfree-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional\nvisuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was\nable to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and\nflexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We\ndemonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent\ndynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,\nand infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through\nvisuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in\nmultitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on\nrepositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest\nreduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.\nAlthough the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish\npredictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,\npointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while\noffering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible\nadaptation in uncertain real-world environments.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing\n(NLP), enabling applications from content generation to decision support.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves LLMs by incorporating external\nknowledge but also introduces security risks, particularly from data poisoning,\nwhere the attacker injects poisoned texts into the knowledge database to\nmanipulate system outputs. While various defenses have been proposed, they\noften struggle against advanced attacks. To address this, we introduce RAGuard,\na detection framework designed to identify poisoned texts. RAGuard first\nexpands the retrieval scope to increase the proportion of clean texts, reducing\nthe likelihood of retrieving poisoned content. It then applies chunk-wise\nperplexity filtering to detect abnormal variations and text similarity\nfiltering to flag highly similar texts. This non-parametric approach enhances\nRAG security, and experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate its\neffectiveness in detecting and mitigating poisoning attacks, including strong\nadaptive attacks.",

However, existing\nevaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to\nmultimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information\nagainst sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG\nevaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information\ncoverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness.

We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three\nprominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the\nlimitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic\nevaluation.

To\naddress this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG\nthrough trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior\napproaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,\nR3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within\nthe RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the\nenvironment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the\nretriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks\ndemonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original\nretriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving\ncomparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on\npost-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,\nrequiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.",

We present PerFine, a\nunified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization\nthrough iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM\ngenerator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic\nLLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on\ntone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then\nrevises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across\niterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as\nBest-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,\nGoodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization\nover PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5\nrefinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size.

Conventional\nrecommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as\nembedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm\nreplaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by\nautoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain\nproprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected\nscaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training\nrecipe that enables competitive performance?\n  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully\nopen-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end\nworkflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and\nrecommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual\nQuantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters\non the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward\ntrend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size,\nvalidating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further\nenhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training\npipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies\nreinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards.

Owing to the massive candidate pool and strict latency constraints,\nindustry systems often rely on lightweight two-tower architectures, which are\ncomputationally efficient yet limited in estimation capability. As a result,\nthey struggle to capture the complex synergistic and suppressive relationships\namong candidate items, which are essential for producing contextually coherent\nand diverse recommendation lists. Moreover, this simplicity further amplifies\nthe Sample Selection Bias (SSB) problem, as coarse-grained models trained on\nbiased exposure data must generalize to a much larger candidate space with\ndistinct distributions.\n  To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{DUET} (\\textbf{DU}al Model\nCo-Training for \\textbf{E}ntire Space C\\textbf{T}R Prediction), a set-wise\npre-ranking framework that achieves expressive modeling under tight\ncomputational budgets. Instead of scoring items independently, DUET performs\nset-level prediction over the entire candidate subset in a single forward pass,\nenabling information-aware interactions among candidates while amortizing the\ncomputational cost across the set. Moreover, a dual model co-training mechanism\nextends supervision to unexposed items via mutual pseudo-label refinement,\neffectively mitigating SSB. Validated through extensive offline experiments and\nonline A/B testing, DUET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nand achieves improvements across multiple core business metrics.

To address these shortcomings, we propose SCOUT\n(Scenario Coverage Oversight and Understanding Tool), a lightweight surrogate\nmodel designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agent's\nlatent sensor representations. SCOUT is trained through a distillation process,\nlearning to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels while eliminating the\nneed for continuous LVLM inference or human annotation.

We evaluate our method\nacross a large dataset of real-life autonomous navigation scenarios,\ndemonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing\ncomputational cost. Our results show that SCOUT provides an effective and\npractical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis.

The factorization converts the nested Bayesian\ndependency into a chain structure, enabling efficient parallel computation: at\nthe lower level, an invariant extended Kalman filter with state augmentation\nestimates trajectories, while a derivative filter computes analytical gradients\nin parallel for upper-level gradient updates. The upper level refines the\ncovariance to guide the lower-level estimation. Experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets show that our method achieves higher efficiency over\nexisting baselines.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained\nrobotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling\nnative temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a\npromising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to\ncomplex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable\nnature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear\noptimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training\non sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited\nsequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging\nits warm-up period.\n  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient\nslope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in\ndeeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,\nwe find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much\nmore pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead\nto a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we\npropose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to\nbootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment\ninteractions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive\nslope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an\naverage return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,\nincluding Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points\nunder the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical\nunderstanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training\nmethodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic\nsystems.",

To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm, Cooperative\nNon-inertial frame-based Obstacle Avoidance (CoNi-OA), designed explicitly for\nUAV-UGV cooperative scenarios without reliance on global state estimation or\nobstacle prediction. CoNi-OA uniquely utilizes a single frame of raw LiDAR data\nfrom the UAV to generate a modulation matrix, which directly adjusts the\nquadrotor's velocity to achieve obstacle avoidance. This modulation-based\nmethod enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the\nUGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less\nthan 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable\nenvironments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a\nmodulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV\ncooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time\ntrajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the\nneed for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static\nand dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or\nunknown scenarios.",

Recently, it has gained\nprominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where\nachieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of\ntasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates\na (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the\ntask's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is\ncompelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that\ncloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its\nfully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg\ninsertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from\nthe Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical\nanalysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with\n$\\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to\nthe demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and\npractice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with\nfewer demonstrated tasks.

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language\nreasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,\nsignificant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical\nspaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level\nactions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large\nlanguage models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor\ngeneralization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate\nseamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across\nembodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \\textbf{Boundless Large\nModel (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves\ninstruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and\nsupports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key\ncapabilities -- \\textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and\ncross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I\ninjects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while\nmaintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an\nintent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to\nguide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported\nby a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot\nembodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital\nand physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four\nmodel families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving\n$\\sim\\!\\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\\sim\\!\\textbf{3%}$ in physical\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a\nsignificant breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ushering in a new era\nof Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). HAI aims to better serve human\nwelfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of\nrobots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex\ntask planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up\nnew pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents\noften lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control\ntasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic\nmanipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical\nworld. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises\na human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an\naction execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a\nvision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task\nperformance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent\nachieves a 28\\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real\nenvironments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly\nimproving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction\ntasks.",

Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation\nLearning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and\ncovariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is\ntypically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and\nmaps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We\nintroduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory\nScoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs\nwithout losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of\nour knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only\nlearning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data.\nZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive\nPolicy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable\nactions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three\nbenchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop\nplanning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM\n(simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the\nstate-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on\nHUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.",

Among\nthese, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to\nidentify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting\nprecise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting\nexample-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images\n(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of\ncapturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To\novercome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that\nunifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide\nembeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a\ncorpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained\nmorphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and\nflexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)\nmosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide\nresearch; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly\nretrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public\npathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including\nanatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,\nand grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and\nstomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional\nimage-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further\ndemonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,\nand enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical\nscenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable\nretrieval solution for digital pathology.",

    "abstract": "The core task of recommender systems is to learn user preferences from\nhistorical user-item interactions. With the rapid development of large language\nmodels (LLMs), recent research has explored leveraging the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs to enhance rating prediction tasks. However, existing\ndistillation-based methods suffer from limitations such as the teacher model's\ninsufficient recommendation capability, costly and static supervision, and\nsuperficial transfer of reasoning ability. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes RecZero, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based recommendation paradigm\nthat abandons the traditional multi-model and multi-stage distillation\napproach. Instead, RecZero trains a single LLM through pure RL to autonomously\ndevelop reasoning capabilities for rating prediction. RecZero consists of two\nkey components: (1) \"Think-before-Recommendation\" prompt construction, which\nemploys a structured reasoning template to guide the model in step-wise\nanalysis of user interests, item features, and user-item compatibility; and (2)\nrule-based reward modeling, which adopts group relative policy optimization\n(GRPO) to compute rewards for reasoning trajectories and optimize the LLM.\nAdditionally, the paper explores a hybrid paradigm, RecOne, which combines\nsupervised fine-tuning with RL, initializing the model with cold-start\nreasoning samples and further optimizing it with RL. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that RecZero and RecOne significantly outperform existing baseline\nmethods on multiple benchmark datasets, validating the superiority of the RL\nparadigm in achieving autonomous reasoning-enhanced recommender systems.",

    "abstract": "Financial documents are essential sources of information for regulators,\nauditors, and financial institutions, particularly for assessing the wealth and\ncompliance of Small and Medium-sized Businesses. However, SMB documents are\noften difficult to parse. They are rarely born digital and instead are\ndistributed as scanned images that are none machine readable. The scans\nthemselves are low in resolution, affected by skew or rotation, and often\ncontain noisy backgrounds. These documents also tend to be heterogeneous,\nmixing narratives, tables, figures, and multilingual content within the same\nreport. Such characteristics pose major challenges for automated information\nextraction, especially when relying on end to end large Vision Language Models,\nwhich are computationally expensive, sensitive to noise, and slow when applied\nto files with hundreds of pages.\n  We propose a multistage pipeline that leverages traditional image processing\nmodels and OCR extraction, together with compact VLMs for structured field\nextraction of large-scale financial documents. Our approach begins with image\npre-processing, including segmentation, orientation detection, and size\nnormalization. Multilingual OCR is then applied to recover page-level text.\nUpon analyzing the text information, pages are retrieved for coherent sections.\nFinally, compact VLMs are operated within these narrowed-down scopes to extract\nstructured financial indicators.\n  Our approach is evaluated using an internal corpus of multi-lingual, scanned\nfinancial documents. The results demonstrate that compact VLMs, together with a\nmultistage pipeline, achieves 8.8 times higher field level accuracy relative to\ndirectly feeding the whole document into large VLMs, only at 0.7 percent of the\nGPU cost and 92.6 percent less end-to-end service latency.",

In this paper, we propose\nTagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy\nthat boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and\naltering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our\nhypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant\nquestion-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging\nthe context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to\nconsistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token\ncontexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop\nqueries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text.

Existing POI\nrecommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and\nsequential models, have been extensively studied.

To overcome this limitation, we propose\nGTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.\nGTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces\nfor different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in\nhyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel\nMamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent\nspace. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses\nspatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),\nenabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on\nthree real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.",

This greatly restricts users' ability to express diverse intents\nand hinders the scalability of the visual search system. This mismatch between\nuser implicit intent expression and system response defines the User-SearchSys\nIntent Discrepancy. To alleviate the issue, we propose a novel framework\nREVISION. This framework integrates offline reasoning mining with online\ndecision-making and execution, enabling adaptive strategies to solve implicit\nuser demands. In the offline stage, we construct a periodic pipeline to mine\ndiscrepancies from historical no-click requests. Leveraging large models, we\nanalyze implicit intent factors and infer optimal suggestions by jointly\nreasoning over query and product metadata. These inferred suggestions serve as\nactionable insights for refining platform strategies. In the online stage,\nREVISION-R1-3B, trained on the curated offline data, performs holistic analysis\nover query images and associated historical products to generate optimization\nplans and adaptively schedule strategies across the search pipeline. Our\nframework offers a streamlined paradigm for integrating large models with\ntraditional search systems, enabling end-to-end intelligent optimization across\ninformation aggregation and user interaction.

However,\ntheir ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,\nespecially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained\nquery-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet effective unified framework $\\text{E}^2\\text{Rank}$, means Efficient\nEmbedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single\ntext embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise\nreranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective,\nthereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying\ncosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified\nranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the\noriginal query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query\nenriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance\nfeedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the\nefficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while\nsignificantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically,\n$\\textrm{E}^2\\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR\nreranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the\nreasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency.

    "abstract": "Users tend to remember failures of a search session more than its many\nsuccesses. This observation has led to work on search robustness, where systems\nare penalized if they perform very poorly on some queries. However, this\nprinciple of robustness has been overlooked within a single query. An ambiguous\nor underspecified query (e.g., ``jaguar'') can have several user intents, where\npopular intents often dominate the ranking, leaving users with minority intents\nunsatisfied. Although the diversification literature has long recognized this\nissue, existing metrics only model the average relevance across intents and\nprovide no robustness guarantees. More surprisingly, we show theoretically and\nempirically that many well-known diversification algorithms are no more robust\nthan a naive, non-diversified algorithm. To address this critical gap, we\npropose to frame diversification as a risk-minimization problem. We introduce\nVRisk, which measures the expected risk faced by the least-served fraction of\nintents in a query. Optimizing VRisk produces a robust ranking, reducing the\nlikelihood of poor user experiences. We then propose VRisker, a fast greedy\nre-ranker with provable approximation guarantees. Finally, experiments on NTCIR\nINTENT-2, TREC Web 2012, and MovieLens show the vulnerability of existing\nmethods. VRisker reduces worst-case intent failures by up to 33% with a minimal\n2% drop in average performance.",
