    "abstract": "Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing\nsource of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves\na 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website\nis available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies.",

Here we ask whether such interventions create\nout-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises\nconcerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target\nmodel in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common\ncausal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away\nfrom the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences\nthat occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within\nbehavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate\nhidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an\neffort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent\n(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to\nthe natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while\npreserving the interpretive power of interventions.

This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of\nquestions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce\nan auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a\nslate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified\nrepresentation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the\ngeneral utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime\nof $O(mn\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number\nof proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical\ndeliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions\nposed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions\nchosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current\nlimitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes.

    "abstract": "In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics\nof relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between\npatients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be\nbroadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range\nspatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also\nsupporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for\nrelational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal\ninformation merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather\nthan a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.\nTo address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances\nglobal context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture\ntemporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph\nPerceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning\nthat leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently\nintegrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent\nbottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common\nlatent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire\nrelational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder\nthat supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a\nsingle model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers\nstate-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for\nrelational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.",

    "abstract": "Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming\ndrainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood\nprediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,\npractical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full\nimplementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow\nconditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents\na data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to\noptimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater\nsystem, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case\nstudy. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate\nprofiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -\nleveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR\nfactorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes\nbased on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the\nrepresentativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the\nDSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three\noptimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction\nperformance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to\n75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty\nin measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and\nimproves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances\ncomputational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy\nflow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further\nintegrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time\ncontrol under limited sensing and monitoring resource.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in\nspecialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing\nevaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to\ncapture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge\napproaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper\nintroduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for\nthe rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an\nagentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)\ndatasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to\nensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge\nmetrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to\nachieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to\nevaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military\noperations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is\nhighly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter\nconfiguration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis\non the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings\nhighlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst,\nwhich empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make\ninformed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems.\nRAGalyst is available on our Github.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in\ndomains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet\nhow closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.\nThis gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical\napplications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs\nineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a\ndigital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic\nprompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing\nthree open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama\nreproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human\ndeviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash\nequilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral\nreplication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation\nprocess. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and\npreregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the\noriginal parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated\nLLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic\nexploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary\napproach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that\ngenerates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a deep Koopman-based Economic Model Predictive Control\n(EMPC) for efficient operation of a laboratory-scale pasteurization unit (PU).\nThe method uses Koopman operator theory to transform the complex, nonlinear\nsystem dynamics into a linear representation, enabling the application of\nconvex optimization while representing the complex PU accurately. The deep\nKoopman model utilizes neural networks to learn the linear dynamics from\nexperimental data, achieving a 45% improvement in open-loop prediction accuracy\nover conventional N4SID subspace identification. Both analyzed models were\nemployed in the EMPC formulation that includes interpretable economic costs,\nsuch as energy consumption, material losses due to inadequate pasteurization,\nand actuator wear. The feasibility of EMPC is ensured using slack variables.\nThe deep Koopman EMPC and N4SID EMPC are numerically validated on a nonlinear\nmodel of multivariable PU under external disturbance. The disturbances include\nfeed pump fail-to-close scenario and the introduction of a cold batch to be\npastuerized. These results demonstrate that the deep Koopmand EMPC achieves a\n32% reduction in total economic cost compared to the N4SID baseline. This\nimprovement is mainly due to the reductions in material losses and energy\nconsumption. Furthermore, the steady-state operation via Koopman-based EMPC\nrequires 10.2% less electrical energy. The results highlight the practical\nadvantages of integrating deep Koopman representations with economic\noptimization to achieve resource-efficient control of thermal-intensive plants.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but\noften rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution\nshifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,\nwhere models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have\nmade progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still\nconstrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the\nembedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this\nlimitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for\nWorst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes\nfeature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that\nworst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on\nspurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean\nembeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at\nthe embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while\nreducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on\nmultiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as \"agents\" for\ndecision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they\nwere not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle\neven in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative\nRegret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure\nthat repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base\nmodel. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,\nselects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior\nmethods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely\non manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the\nregret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.\nThis reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and\nprovides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results\nshow that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -\nfrom Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and\nadvanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and\nreasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,\naction spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we\nprovide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this\nparadigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,\nIterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for\nenhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.",

We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and\nNarens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the\nMonitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify\nparadigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences\n(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins\nand refines future monitoring through verification feedback.

However, existing approaches to handling missing data in\nlongitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian\nnetworks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the\ndata. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is\nparticularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding\nthe temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and\napplicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a\nfull Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains\nunderdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method\nfor learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as\nan unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the\nunobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions,\nallowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our\nmethod on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from\ncritically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as\nMICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and\nconvergence properties.

Conventional\ncircuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are\nresource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To\naddress these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware\nco-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM.\nInitially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties\nof PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between\nPIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS,\nenabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while\nmaintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently,\nwe develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates\nsoftware-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt\nthe V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and\nperformance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging\nsoftware and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement.

    "abstract": "In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained\nby training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as\ndirections in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely\nassumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its\ntarget concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone\nis an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV\ncaptures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to\ncapture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended\nconcept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned\nprobes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close\nto that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a\nnovel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and\nprovide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization\ntechniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further\npropose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept\nalignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our\nanalysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment\nconsistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for\nalignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the\nimportance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of\nthe target concept.",

The\ndevelopment of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on\ncomprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,\nparticularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By\ntraining deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination\nof synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth\nquarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of\nGuinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic\ntraining data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by\napplying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf\nof Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic\ntransferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model\ngeneralises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were\ndetected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and\n1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which\nimproved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic\ndata enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model\nperformance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of\noffshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced\ndatasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to\naddress common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of\ndeep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.",

Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy\ndiversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework\nbuilt on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard\ntraining process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the\nsolution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to\ncreate an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling\nFine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting\npoint for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via\niterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations\ninto robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting\nand substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and\npass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.",

    "abstract": "The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models\nhas turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical\nchallenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that\ndiffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,\nknown as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent\nrepresentations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a\nsignal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates\nclosed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the\nlearned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.\nOperating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates\npartial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A\ntemporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a\nfeature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables\ntransparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro\nAUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under\npost-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong\nseparability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate\nthat modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and\ninterpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics.

This may cause\nattenuation of collaborative signals: removing edges between two nodes can\ninterrupt paths between other nodes, weakening path-dependent collaborative\ninformation. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel\nGNN-based CF model called DRCSD for denoising unstable interactions. DRCSD\nincludes two core modules: a collaborative signal decoupling module (decomposes\nsignals into distinct orders by structural characteristics) and an order-wise\ndenoising module (performs targeted denoising on each order). Additionally, the\ninformation aggregation mechanism of traditional GNN-based CF models is\nmodified to avoid cross-order signal interference until the final pooling\noperation. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that\nDRCSD has superior robustness against unstable interactions and achieves\nstatistically significant performance improvements in recommendation accuracy\nmetrics compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.",

We introduce a\nmulti-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the\nminimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information\nbottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to\ncommunicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a\ngrid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,\nemerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon\nthis internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient\ncommunication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode\npartners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells\n(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical\nreinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint\nuncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional\nresilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to\n64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast\nbaseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%.

Although recent theoretical studies have\nestablished the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for\ntransformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,\nthe current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head\nattention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this\ngap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.\nWe prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension\n$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it\ncontains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input\ndimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for\nMHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We\nempirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the\napproximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)\nand an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the\nhidden dimension of the source model.",

LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)\nproposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication\nintermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and\nfacilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating\ncycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic\ncommunication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,\nprofessional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying\nLLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about\ninformation fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper\nsystematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment\nacross multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental\ndimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction\nduring sender interviews across different communication types, (2)\nReproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple\ninteraction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of\nrecipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or\nfabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,\nwe assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.\nPreliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before\nLAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.",

In digital\npathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of\ninformation from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting\napplications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate\nregistration of images from different modalities is an essential step in\ndigital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color\ntransformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset\nof 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing\nsteps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,\nVahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and\ndenoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,\nwhich first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration\nin two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance\nwas evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported\nthe median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values\n(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based\nevaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done\nseparately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal\nimages. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest\nregistration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These\nfindings show that applying color transformation before registration improves\nalignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable\nanalysis in digital pathology.",

Furthermore,\na lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to\ncapture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.\nAnother branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by\nconstructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation\nwithin the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.\nFinally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines\nmotion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,\nocclusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset\ndemonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT\nattains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while\nmaintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.\nCode is available at:\nhttps://github.com/BiscuitsLzy/DMSORT-An-efficient-parallel-maritime-multi-object-tracking-architecture-.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a\nsequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to\noutput a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses\nbeyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that\nlanguage identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any\ninteresting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise\ncharacterization of language collections for which this task is possible.\nMotivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language\ngeneration, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the\nsetting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of\n$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite\ntime, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.\n  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be\n$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's\ncharacterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This\nfurther leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language\ncollection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the\ncollection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which\ncan be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our\ncharacterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical\nsetting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution\nsupported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a\ncollection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be\n$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the\nother hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it\ncannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.",

Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort\nlearned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this\nchallenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for\ncontaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an\nattribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to\nlearn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder\nanchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node\nembeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving\nrepresentation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive\nlearning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous\nones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level\nrepresentations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art UGAD baselines.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently\nchallenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area\nsearch and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a\nsignificant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine\ncollaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an\nerror-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a\nlow-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,\nthis study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed\nframework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and\nmulti-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It\nthen employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,\nhierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This\nclosed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,\nproviding active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual\nmonitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR\ntask. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and\ncommand-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task\ncompletion time by approximately $64.2\\%$ and improved task success rate by\n$7\\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive\nworkload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\\%$.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across\ndiverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained\nInternet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter\nfootprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing\noffers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge\ndevices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique\nchallenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token\ngeneration process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work\nintroduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed\nexplicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key\ncontributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a\nmixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by\nstrategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with\ndifferent precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate\ncompression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise\nadaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations\nwhile dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a\nunified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,\nquantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and\nlatency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware\nplatforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art\nquantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework\nachieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead\nreduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the\nglobe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same\ntime, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and\noptimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs\ncan represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle\nground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,\nbut too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent\ncultural diversity.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop\nexplainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an\nalternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned\nrepresentations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our\nfindings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to\napproximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational\nmappings.",

    "abstract": "Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced rapidly with Large Language\nModels (LLMs), but most existing methods remain computationally expensive, and\nfocused on a small set of languages. Ruby, despite its widespread use in web\ndevelopment and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received\nlittle attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel\nlightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven,\niterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that\ngenerate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a\ncorrect solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid\nreliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead\noperating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven\nfeedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a\npass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly\nwithin five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and\nself-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that\nRAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors,\nand runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair\nstrategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging\ntools to under-studied languages.",

However, most recent\nreinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress\nexternal forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically\nrestricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme\nforces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a\nframework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking\npolicy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based\nformulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing\nagainst surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human\nmotion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across\nthe shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse\ninteraction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable\nforce thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,\nincluding gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object\nmanipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak\ncontact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more\nnatural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots\nthat can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in\nreal-world environments.",

    "abstract": "Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing\nsource of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves\na 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website\nis available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.",

    "abstract": "We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from\nreactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader\nparadigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond\nlinguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),\nstreaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),\nimplicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and\npredictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize\ninformation). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering\nnarrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that\nrequire true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we\npresent VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial\nrecall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require\narbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context\nexpansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training\nCambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without\nsacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,\nindicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We\npropose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in\nwhich a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise\n(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this\napproach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that\nspatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,\nselect, and organize experience.",

Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without\nstrong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and\nsuperficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric\nbenchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic\nprinciple for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.\nDesigners should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using\ndiagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate\nnon-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test\nset'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.\n  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose\nbenchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.\nOur primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language\nModel via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual\ninputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a\nbias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based\ndiagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.\nSecond, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an\n``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four\nbenchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive\nnon-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create\nVSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider\nvision-blind performance gap than the original.",

Here, we introduce an\nautomated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across\nsixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,\nwe generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by\neach virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to\ncompute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly\nquantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual\nannotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,\nincluding Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),\nand structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and\npathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE\nachieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based\nmodels are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.\nMoreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are\ninvisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level\nbenchmarks.

To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy\nof explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,\ne.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local\nregions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual\ndescriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language\nalignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder\nfundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded\nin long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing\nboth visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a\nnovel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and\nprocess lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an\nautomated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,\nlong-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we\nconstruct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million\nsamples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and\npropose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating\nfine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual\ndescriptions at arbitrary granularity.

Moreover, most training\nparadigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language\nbackbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.\nIn this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces\ncomputation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong\nperformance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native\nmultimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated\ndiffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together\nforming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training\nparadigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the\nrepresentations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1\nachieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,\nsurpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also\nattains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations,\nEvo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory\noverhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model\nweights to facilitate future research on lightweight and efficient VLA models.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in\nLaparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with\nlonger operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The\nParkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for\nstratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos\nremains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete\nvideos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,\nwe introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity\nestimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal\nsupervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed\nclips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal\nlocalization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading\nmodule. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft\nlocalization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:\nEvaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy\nof 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by\nover 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision\nfor surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable\nand effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation\nfrom full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and\nsurgical training.",

However, the rapid advance in generation has\noutpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the\nassessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,\nevaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user\nstudies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8\nmetrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)\nsynchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as\nwell as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we\nstreamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as\nwell as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by\n17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip\nsynchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and\nartifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real\ndataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data.

Once a network has been trained, however, its\nmemory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we\nfocus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.\nWhereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing\nan isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use\ndata-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we\nminimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed\nas $\\lVert (W - \\widetilde{W}) \\Sigma^{1/2}\\rVert_F$ where $\\Sigma^{1/2}$ is\nthe square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,\n$\\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new\nalternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor\ndecompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike\nconventional compression pipelines, which almost always require\npost-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves\ncompetitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same\ncovariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only\na minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training\ndataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50,\nand GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100)\nconfirm the advantages of the proposed method.",

Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated\ndatasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised\nAI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative\nbaseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained\nYOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate\nthe initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data\nfor the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by\nproviding a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further\nmanual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal\nconsistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively\nevaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of\nground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,\nand test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory\nperformance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted\napproach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods\nof complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually\nprompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world\nscenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more\nefficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.",

Existing solutions often apply\nend-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or\nsymbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML).

On the other hand, symbolic\napproaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this\npaper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that\nuses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic\nrepresentation of human demonstrations.

However, efficiently\nextracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and\npredictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional\nchemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial\nintelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,\nenabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise\nchallenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite\nthe wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in\nanalytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,\nstep-by-step guidance for implementing these models.\n  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step\nguide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from\nimaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral\ninformation. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep\nlearning models for image processing but on using existing open source models\nto extract deep features from imaging data.\n  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,\nshowcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities\ncommonly encountered in analytical chemistry.

Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nrepresentations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial\nformat, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although\nBEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through\nmultimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by\nenvironmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D\ndetection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the\nimpact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)\noutputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.\nDetection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the\nnuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera\nocclusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is\nbased only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance\nonly under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),\nwith a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect\ndepends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%\ndrop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%\ndrop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task\nof 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into\nocclusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that\ncan maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or\ndegradation due to adverse environmental conditions.",

For this reason, developing methods for the automated\nsegmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has\ndriven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the\nimpracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,\nusually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when\napplying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,\nin this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,\nvoxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method\nallows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native\n3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while\nsignificantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU\nmemory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context\nof Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23\nchallenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge\nwinners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%\nfor tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone.

The primary issue\nlies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text\nencoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,\nwhich limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these\nchallenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of\nprompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless\nstep instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to\nvarious pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly\nenhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module\ncalled the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden\nstates during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video\ngeneration. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can\nimplicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that\nbetter match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful\ncapabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader\nrange of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a\nversatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model\narchitectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate\nhigh-quality videos that align with user intent.

This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model\ngeneralises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were\ndetected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and\n1,593 in the Persian Gulf.

While landmark detection\nhas traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of\nlarge-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this\nstudy, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation\nmodel designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset\npretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our\nproposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,\ninherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for\nanatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely\nuntapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,\nachieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%\nimprovement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).\nTo further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few\nannotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving\n2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR.

In digital\npathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of\ninformation from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting\napplications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate\nregistration of images from different modalities is an essential step in\ndigital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color\ntransformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset\nof 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing\nsteps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,\nVahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and\ndenoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,\nwhich first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration\nin two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance\nwas evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported\nthe median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values\n(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based\nevaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done\nseparately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal\nimages. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest\nregistration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These\nfindings show that applying color transformation before registration improves\nalignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable\nanalysis in digital pathology.",

Humans can bridge this gap\nby watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short\nsegments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable\ncomputer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.\nWe propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts\nthem into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects\ntrajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a\nVLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,\nand assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage\nselection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context\nat each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its\nnext decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our\nframework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use\nonly textual tutorials or transcripts.

    "abstract": "Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object\ntracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective\nmaritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often\ncauses camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant\nchallenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient\nDual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the\nframework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an\nobject detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated\nbranch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible\nColumnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to\nleverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,\na lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to\ncapture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.\nAnother branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by\nconstructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation\nwithin the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.\nFinally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines\nmotion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,\nocclusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset\ndemonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT\nattains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while\nmaintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.\nCode is available at:\nhttps://github.com/BiscuitsLzy/DMSORT-An-efficient-parallel-maritime-multi-object-tracking-architecture-.",

We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance\nterm exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating\nthe classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our\nerror-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust\nto approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers\nfail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the\ncomputation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with\nthe tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the\nadditional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.\nWe also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively\nselects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large\nextrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up\nto 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\\Delta$ImageReward\n$\\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free\naccelerators under identical computation budgets.

    "abstract": "We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by\nevaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based\nresidual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a\ncommon evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard\nU-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =\n64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer\nschedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234\nSSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an\nunseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly\nbehind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,\nhighlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN\noffers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust\npair-free alternative with competitive performance.

Existing approaches primarily align neural activity\ndirectly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to\ncapture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep\nrobustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first\nend-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain\nalignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and\nlinguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain\nrepresentations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned\nvisual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual\nreliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel\nuncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during\nalignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to\nenhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of\nsingle-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M\nimproves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI\nbenchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and\ncaptioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically\nsurpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task.

    "abstract": "Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in\nthe skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric\nauthentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness\ndetection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal\nquality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and\ninter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and\nclassification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective\nbiometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from\nlow-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings\nfrom 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The\nraw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline\ndrift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude\nnormalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG\nsegment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the\nContinuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient\ncardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed\nCVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision\nTransformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long\nShort-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects\ndemonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the\nmodel to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,\nscalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is\nwell-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.",

    "abstract": "Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about\nothers' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues\nlike whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,\nthe computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and\nsocial interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI\nvision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose\ninformation to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI\nvision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth\nestimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video\nclips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict\nhuman social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,\n3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that\nkey social information is available in explicit body position but not in the\nlearned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise\nembeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the\ncritical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a\ncompact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and\ndirection of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors\nmatched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly\nimproved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with\ntheir embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were\nrepresented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability\nto match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence\nthat human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D\npose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies.",

However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)\nImages capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or\ncontinuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct\nmodalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce \"Thinking with Video\", a new paradigm\nthat leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and\ntextual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,\nwe developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench\nencompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing\nPuzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our\nevaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,\nSora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even\nsurpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric\ntasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.\nFurthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also\nfind that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's\nperformance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation\nmodel is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,\npositions \"thinking with video\" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.",

    "abstract": "As the role of Large Language Models (LLM)-based coding assistants in\nsoftware development becomes more critical, so does the role of the bugs they\ngenerate in the overall cybersecurity landscape. While a number of LLM code\nsecurity benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the\nsecurity of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have\nimpacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest\nopen-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability\nscenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality\ntrade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To\nhelp address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the\nrisk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability\nseverity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces\nvulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation\nof the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the\nModel Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of\nvulnerabilities a model generates.",

In our experiments, we\nfind a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,\nand how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This\nsuggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are\nalternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet\ncommitted to a particular final answer.

These vary in meaning depending on\nthe context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of\nuncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when\nradiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or\ndiagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent\nor simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part\nframework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,\nLLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding\nto a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit\nuncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds\ncharacteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for\n14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,\nuncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured\nradiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image\nclassification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the\nclinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.",

Existing\nevaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to\ncapture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge\napproaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper\nintroduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for\nthe rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an\nagentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)\ndatasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to\nensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge\nmetrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to\nachieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to\nevaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military\noperations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is\nhighly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter\nconfiguration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis\non the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings\nhighlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst,\nwhich empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make\ninformed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems.\nRAGalyst is available on our Github.",

Yet\nhow closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.\nThis gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical\napplications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs\nineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a\ndigital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic\nprompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing\nthree open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama\nreproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human\ndeviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash\nequilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral\nreplication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation\nprocess. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and\npreregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the\noriginal parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated\nLLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic\nexploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary\napproach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that\ngenerates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is\ncritical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently\nambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically\nbenchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that\nwhile current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive\nassumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on\nambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first\nambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer\ndistributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance\ndeterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the\npredictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,\nand an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically\nexplained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators\nare fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key\nshortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of\ncurrent modeling paradigms.",

Experiments on English to Persian and several other language\npairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that\nour method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared\nto an iid baseline.

However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are\nobserved to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,\nrespectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,\nwhich focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected\nby outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation\nof the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high\nvariance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO\nimportance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common\nimportance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,\nleading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a\ndecrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which\napplies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and\nGSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also\nprevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping\nmechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily\nadjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and\nnarrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves\nan average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and\nGSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets.

Yet this assumption remains largely untested.\nExisting validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --\ntesting whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence\nthat such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks\nrobust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating\nmodels to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we\nintroduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates\naggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with\ninterpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to\nassess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.\nSecond, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration\nstrategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval\n-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly\nTwitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the\nliterature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable\nfrom human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.\nInstruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up\nmodel size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:\noptimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and\nvice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for\nvalidation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note\nabout their current limitations in capturing human communication.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the\ncorrect orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical\npre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is\nessential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical\nCharacter Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user\nerrors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.\nIn this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for\nevaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from\nrotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)\nORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource\nlanguages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation\nclassification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model\nwith dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task\nin a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy\non identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond\nclassification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR\nperformance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in\nthe simulated real-world setting.",

We conduct a\ncomprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching\nimproves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by\n3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses\noverthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and\nencourages more decisive answers.

    "abstract": "The diffusion of ideas and language in society has conventionally been\ndescribed by S-shaped models, such as the logistic curve. However, the role of\nsub-exponential growth -a slower than exponential pattern known in\nepidemiology- has been largely overlooked in broader social phenomena. Here, we\npresent a piecewise power-law model to characterize complex growth curves with\na few parameters. We systematically analyzed a large-scale dataset of\napproximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked to Wikipedia\nvocabulary, and observed consistent patterns in web search trend data (English,\nSpanish, and Japanese). Our analysis of the 2,965 selected items reveals that\nabout 55% (1,625 items) were found to have no abrupt jumps and were well\ncaptured by one or two segments. For single-segment curves, we found that (i)\nthe mode of the shape parameter alpha was near 0.5, indicating prevalent\nsub-exponential growth; (ii) the ultimate diffusion scale is primarily\ndetermined by the growth rate R, with minor contributions from alpha or the\nduration T; and (iii) alpha showed a tendency to vary with the nature of the\ntopic, being smaller for niche/local topics and larger for widely shared ones.\nFurthermore, a micro-behavioral model distinguishing outward contact with\nstrangers from inward interaction within their community suggests that alpha\ncan be interpreted as an index of the preference for outward-oriented\ncommunication. These findings suggest that sub-exponential growth is a common\npattern of social diffusion, and our model provides a practical framework for\nconsistently describing, comparing, and interpreting complex and diverse growth\ncurves.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a\nsequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to\noutput a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses\nbeyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that\nlanguage identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any\ninteresting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise\ncharacterization of language collections for which this task is possible.\nMotivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language\ngeneration, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the\nsetting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of\n$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite\ntime, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.\n  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be\n$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's\ncharacterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This\nfurther leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language\ncollection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the\ncollection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which\ncan be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our\ncharacterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical\nsetting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution\nsupported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a\ncollection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be\n$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the\nother hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it\ncannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.",

We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI\ngeneration using a \"hide-in-plain-sight\" method and (2) performance against\ncommercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all\nPHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the\nPenn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining\nthe previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation\nshowed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50\nindependently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor\nsystems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).\nDiscussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional\ngeneralization and robustness.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a\ncontrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed\nPlan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence\nof sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance\nfor reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store\n(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively\nretrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining\nstructured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances\nthe interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive\nexperiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly\nimproves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the\nperformance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.",

However, end-to-end\nfine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational\ncosts and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an\nefficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which\nreduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the\ndistribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively\nreduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of\noverfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which\nreplaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In\na variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior\nperformance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\\times$ acceleration\nand 10$\\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.\nFurthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration\nfor a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language\nmodels feasible in resource-constrained environments.

    "abstract": "We study explorability, a measure of nondeterminism in pushdown automata,\nwhich generalises history-determinism. An automaton is k-explorable if, while\nreading the input, it suffices to follow k concurrent runs, built step-by-step\nbased only on the input seen so far, to construct an accepting one, if it\nexists. We show that the class of explorable PDAs lies strictly between\nhistory-deterministic and fully nondeterministic PDAs in terms of both\nexpressiveness and succinctness. In fact increasing explorability induces an\ninfinite hierarchy: each level k defines a strictly more expressive class than\nlevel k-1, yet the entire class remains less expressive than general\nnondeterministic PDAs. We then introduce a parameterized notion of\nexplorability, where the number of runs may depend on input length, and show\nthat exponential explorability precisely captures the context-free languages.\nFinally, we prove that explorable PDAs can be doubly exponentially more\nsuccinct than history-deterministic ones, and that the succinctness gap between\ndeterministic and 2-explorable PDAs is not recursively enumerable. These\nresults position explorability as a robust and operationally meaningful measure\nof nondeterminism for pushdown systems.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to\nas Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance\nin knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved\nevidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,\n\\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing\npremises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge\nthese gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive\ninference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient\nevidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through\nconsistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive\nreasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both\nanswer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the\nglobe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same\ntime, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and\noptimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs\ncan represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle\nground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,\nbut too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent\ncultural diversity.",

While pre-trained\ntransformer-based language models have significantly advanced natural language\ngeneration, they often struggle to precisely control problem complexity and\ncognitive demands.

This approach leverages multiple agents that iteratively refine generated\nquestion-answer pairs to better balance complexity and cognitive demand. We\nevaluate the generated questions on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance,\nimportance, clarity, difficulty matching, answerability, to assess the system's\nability to control the required complexity and quality of the questions.\nPreliminary evaluations show that this collaborative multi-agent framework\nelevates the quality of generated educational content by fostering a more\nnuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity. These promising\noutcomes suggest that integrating collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield\nmore controlled, pedagogically valuable content that can help advance automated\neducational content generation and adaptive learning environments.",

To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference\npipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic\ncontaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs.\nOur forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter\nconstraints, achieving $2-3\\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\\Omega_m -\nS_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and\neffectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination.

Classical Test Theory analysis\nreveals that 55\\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \\geq 0.40$)\nwhile 30\\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.\nQuestion 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful\ndiscriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA\nF-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance\n(0.206), accounting for 20.6\\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms\ndemonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting\nachieving 97.5\\% and 96.0\\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering\nidentifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\\%,\ndiverging from the institutional threshold of 55\\% and suggesting potential\noverclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits\nexceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster\npurity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:\nreplace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and\nintegrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These\nfindings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical\nfoundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.",

Addressing this\nproblem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades\nof study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the\nunderlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic\ntheory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a\nlearner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a\nloss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure\nof an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a\ncomprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,\ngenerative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate\nhow forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant\nrole in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a\nprincipled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and\nimproving the information retention capabilities of general learning\nalgorithms.",

A residual branch captures small-scale convective\ninitiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic\nmodule estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up\nto three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\\%\nof cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists.

    "abstract": "A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that\ntheir inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and\ncostly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of\nlanguage models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion\nmodel (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens\nout-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,\nthere is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling\nthese models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling\nperformance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but\nthese are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we\ngive a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true\ndistribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any\nunmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory\nof univariate function approximation.\n  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and\nupper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation\nin principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show\nthat it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori\nknowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we\nalso demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of\nwell-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,\nits total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some\nnatural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss\nin performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.",

Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies.",

Finally, in an\neffort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent\n(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to\nthe natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while\npreserving the interpretive power of interventions.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics\nand traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to\nachieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a\nnatural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While\nthe problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent\nsettings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In\nthis work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized\nmulti-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the\ntransition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying\nnovel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.\nOur main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on\nthe construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our\nregret lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the\ninherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning\ncomplexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of\nefficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the\ncomplexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring\ncomplexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a\nsystem induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is\ncomplex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an\ninformation advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of\nemergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and\nobserver-dependent structure. The framework suggests that \"interesting\" systems\nare those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers,\nproviding a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally\nvaluable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss\nimplications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.",

Traditional\nnumerical methods require re-solving the PDE for each parameter, making\nparameter space exploration prohibitively expensive. Recent machine learning\nadvances, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural\noperators, have revolutionized parametric PDE solving by learning solution\noperators that generalize across parameter spaces. We critically analyze two\nmain paradigms: (1) PINNs, which embed physical laws as soft constraints and\nexcel at inverse problems with sparse data, and (2) neural operators (e.g.,\nDeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator), which learn mappings between\ninfinite-dimensional function spaces and achieve unprecedented generalization.\nThrough comparisons across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and\nelectromagnetics, we show neural operators can achieve computational speedups\nof $10^3$ to $10^5$ times faster than traditional solvers for multi-query\nscenarios, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We provide practical guidance\nfor method selection, discuss theoretical foundations (universal approximation,\nconvergence), and identify critical open challenges: high-dimensional\nparameters, complex geometries, and out-of-distribution generalization.

We\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced\nusing GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of\nspiders.

This study shows that Riesz regression is closely related to direct\ndensity-ratio estimation (DRE) in important cases, including average treat-\nment effect (ATE) estimation. Specifically, the idea and objective in Riesz\nregression coincide with the one in least-squares importance fitting (LSIF,\nKanamori et al., 2009) in direct density-ratio estimation. While Riesz\nregression is general in the sense that it can be applied to Riesz representer\nestimation in a wide class of problems, the equivalence with DRE allows us to\ndirectly import exist- ing results in specific cases, including\nconvergence-rate analyses, the selection of loss functions via\nBregman-divergence minimization, and regularization techniques for flexible\nmodels, such as neural networks. Conversely, insights about the Riesz\nrepresenter in debiased machine learning broaden the applications of direct\ndensity-ratio estimation methods.

This\npaper presents machine-learning-driven reduced models for Electron Temperature\nGradient (ETG) turbulence in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator. Each model\npredicts the ETG heat flux as a function of three plasma parameters: the\nnormalized electron temperature radial gradient ($\\omega_{T_e}$), the ratio of\nnormalized electron temperature and density radial gradients ($\\eta_e$), and\nthe electron-to-ion temperature ratio ($\\tau$). We first construct models\nacross seven radial locations using regression and an active\nmachine-learning-based procedure. This process initializes models using\nlow-cardinality sparse-grid training data and then iteratively refines their\ntraining sets by selecting the most informative points from a pre-existing\nsimulation database. We evaluate the prediction capabilities of our models\nusing out-of-sample datasets with over $393$ points per location, and $95\\%$\nprediction intervals are estimated via bootstrapping to assess prediction\nuncertainty. We then investigate the construction of generalized reduced\nmodels, including a generic, position-independent model, and assess their heat\nflux prediction capabilities at three additional locations.

To be\nbroadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range\nspatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also\nsupporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for\nrelational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal\ninformation merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather\nthan a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.\nTo address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances\nglobal context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture\ntemporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph\nPerceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning\nthat leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently\nintegrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent\nbottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common\nlatent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire\nrelational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder\nthat supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a\nsingle model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers\nstate-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for\nrelational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.",

Herein, we show that our method\nscales well to a more challenging demand response case study built on a\nlarge-scale model of a single-product (nitrogen) air separation unit. Across\nall numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically\nmeasurable plant variables.

Once a network has been trained, however, its\nmemory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we\nfocus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.\nWhereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing\nan isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use\ndata-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we\nminimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed\nas $\\lVert (W - \\widetilde{W}) \\Sigma^{1/2}\\rVert_F$ where $\\Sigma^{1/2}$ is\nthe square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,\n$\\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new\nalternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor\ndecompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike\nconventional compression pipelines, which almost always require\npost-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves\ncompetitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same\ncovariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only\na minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training\ndataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50,\nand GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100)\nconfirm the advantages of the proposed method.",

The core idea is to dynamically select an algorithm for each round,\nchoosing between two candidates: (1) an empirically optimal algorithm derived\nfrom the history of observations, and (2) a sample-based algorithm with a\nproven competitive ratio guarantee. Based on this approach, we design an\nalgorithm that performs no worse than the baseline sample-based algorithm in\nevery round, while ensuring that the total regret is bounded by\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$.\n  We demonstrate the broad applicability of our framework to canonical\nproblems, including the prophet inequality, the secretary problem, and their\nvariants under adversarial, random, and i.i.d. input models. For example, for\nthe repeated prophet inequality problem, our method achieves a\n$1/2$-competitive ratio from the second round on and an $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$\nregret.

This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,\nwhere models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have\nmade progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still\nconstrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the\nembedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this\nlimitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for\nWorst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes\nfeature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that\nworst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on\nspurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean\nembeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at\nthe embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while\nreducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on\nmultiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy.

    "abstract": "The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed\nTomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a\nbottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the\nclinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated\nsegmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has\ndriven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the\nimpracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,\nusually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when\napplying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,\nin this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,\nvoxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method\nallows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native\n3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while\nsignificantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU\nmemory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context\nof Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23\nchallenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge\nwinners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%\nfor tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also\noffers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction\nin inference time and up to a 75\\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an\nequivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are increasingly used in healthcare due to\ntheir ability to model complex temporal relationships in patient data while\nmaintaining interpretability, an essential feature for clinical\ndecision-making. However, existing approaches to handling missing data in\nlongitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian\nnetworks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the\ndata. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is\nparticularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding\nthe temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and\napplicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a\nfull Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains\nunderdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method\nfor learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as\nan unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the\nunobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions,\nallowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our\nmethod on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from\ncritically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as\nMICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and\nconvergence properties. These results highlight the clinical relevance of\nincorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models, providing more\nreliable imputations and offering deeper insight into model behavior. Our\napproach supports safer and more informed clinical decision-making,\nparticularly in settings where missing data are frequent and potentially\nimpactful.",

However, the pursuit of higher\nperformance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating\nfrequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly\ndegrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional\ncircuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are\nresource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To\naddress these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware\nco-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM.\nInitially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties\nof PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between\nPIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS,\nenabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while\nmaintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently,\nwe develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates\nsoftware-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt\nthe V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and\nperformance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging\nsoftware and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout\nsimulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up\nto 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement\nand 1.152x speedup.",

In this paper, we\npropose a novel online conformal inference method with retrospective\nadjustment, which is designed to achieve faster adaptation to distributional\nshifts.

In this work, we develop an\nautomated pipeline to measure various characteristics of quantum machine\nlearning ansatzes with respect to symmetries that can appear in the learning\ntask. We define the degree of symmetry in the learning problem as the size of\nthe subgroup it admits.

Symmetrizing the 19 common ansatzes with respect to\nthese varying-sized subgroup representations, we compute three classes of\nmetrics that describe how the common ansatz structures behave under varying\namounts of symmetries. The first metric is based on the norm of the difference\nbetween the original and symmetrized generators, while the second metric counts\ndepth, size, and other characteristics from the symmetrized circuits. The third\nclass of metrics includes expressibility and entangling capability. The results\ndemonstrate varying gate overhead across the studied ansatzes and confirm that\nincreased symmetry reduces expressibility of the circuits.

Although recent theoretical studies have\nestablished the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for\ntransformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,\nthe current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head\nattention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this\ngap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.\nWe prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension\n$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it\ncontains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input\ndimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for\nMHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We\nempirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the\napproximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)\nand an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the\nhidden dimension of the source model.",

Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient\ndeployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge.\nWhile most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of\nMXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--\nraises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,\nwe establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.\nThrough systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently\ndeliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost\nused by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility\nwith MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,\ntracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)\nblock scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation\nstrategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial\naccuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear\nguidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research\nunder emerging low-precision formats.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to\naddress challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous\nElectronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,\nlarge modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes\nmulti-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to\nachieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A\nlearnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic\nevolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head\nself-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal\nsequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term\nfluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic\nrepresentation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign\nadaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability\nof risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates\nindividual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model\noutperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in\naccuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk\nidentification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an\nefficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.",

We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and\nflow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their\ntransferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory\ndatasets.

Results show that\ndiffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of\nthe Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently\noutperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual\ninspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from\npretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show\nweaker generalization.

Such constraints typically appear when\nsafety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,\nsuch as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In\nthis paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic\nframework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded\nsafety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite\nconstraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint\nexpansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations\nexceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those\nwith zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This\nexchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports\neffective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under\nmild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to\noptimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a\nprescribed bound.",

Classical results of Gold showed that\nlanguage identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any\ninteresting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise\ncharacterization of language collections for which this task is possible.\nMotivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language\ngeneration, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the\nsetting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of\n$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite\ntime, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.\n  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be\n$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's\ncharacterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This\nfurther leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language\ncollection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the\ncollection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which\ncan be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our\ncharacterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical\nsetting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution\nsupported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a\ncollection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be\n$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the\nother hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it\ncannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains,\nunsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task.\nUGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral\npatterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume\nthat the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely\ntrue in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort\nlearned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this\nchallenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for\ncontaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an\nattribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to\nlearn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder\nanchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node\nembeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving\nrepresentation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive\nlearning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous\nones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level\nrepresentations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art UGAD baselines.",

    "abstract": "Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest\nvectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of\ndiscrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each\nretrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter\nawareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter\nsatisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent\npenalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and\nvector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that\nlearns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly\nfrom the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a\nconstrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect\nthe underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered\nANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and\nindex construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture\nthe underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-\nproves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible\nand generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.",

While split computing\noffers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge\ndevices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique\nchallenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token\ngeneration process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work\nintroduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed\nexplicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key\ncontributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a\nmixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by\nstrategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with\ndifferent precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate\ncompression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise\nadaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations\nwhile dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a\nunified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,\nquantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and\nlatency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware\nplatforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art\nquantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph\nstructural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost\nand structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in\nmulti-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model\ndependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and\npaths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural\nconstraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters\nare embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable\nmechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior\nguidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training\nstability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in\nmulti-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,\nenvironmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically\nanalyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and\nrelation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior\nperformance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate\nthat the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,\nadapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while\nmaintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages\nof graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable\nevolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of\nimmune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and\nvaccine development.\n  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have\nrevolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to\nnoisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce\nPETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based\non evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw\nRNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures\nthe hierarchical structure of viral evolution.\n  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and\ntemporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future\nSARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide\nmutations and 17.10\\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and\n6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability\nto aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and\n25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra",

However, existing CD models are largely designed\nwithout privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.\nDirectly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they\nstruggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when\nconfronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address\nthis, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning\nproblem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical\nimportanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance\nin CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this\nvia an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level\nimportance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with\nthe data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that\nHIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first\neffective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and\nfor deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems",

This addresses a critical\nand open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy\nconstraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem\nby introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for\ntraining to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first\nproxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance\nmeasures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of\nthese metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that\nleverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies\ncorrelate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment\nanalysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS\nconsistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced\ncharacteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3\nsynthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to\n38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work\nestablishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under\nreal-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data\ncharacterization and fine-grained data selection.",

    "abstract": "Although the collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm has achieved remarkable\nperformance in recommendation systems, it suffers from suboptimal\nrecommendation performance due to noise in the user-item interaction matrix.\nNumerous noise-removal studies have improved recommendation models, but most\nexisting approaches conduct denoising on a single graph. This may cause\nattenuation of collaborative signals: removing edges between two nodes can\ninterrupt paths between other nodes, weakening path-dependent collaborative\ninformation. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel\nGNN-based CF model called DRCSD for denoising unstable interactions. DRCSD\nincludes two core modules: a collaborative signal decoupling module (decomposes\nsignals into distinct orders by structural characteristics) and an order-wise\ndenoising module (performs targeted denoising on each order). Additionally, the\ninformation aggregation mechanism of traditional GNN-based CF models is\nmodified to avoid cross-order signal interference until the final pooling\noperation. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that\nDRCSD has superior robustness against unstable interactions and achieves\nstatistically significant performance improvements in recommendation accuracy\nmetrics compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.",

    "abstract": "Production vector search systems often fan out each query across parallel\nlanes (threads, replicas, or shards) to meet latency service-level objectives\n(SLOs). In practice, these lanes rediscover the same candidates, so extra\ncompute does not increase coverage. We present a coordination-free lane\npartitioner that turns duplication into complementary work at the same cost and\ndeadline. For each query we (1) build a deterministic candidate pool sized to\nthe total top-k budget, (2) apply a per-query pseudorandom permutation, and (3)\nassign each lane a disjoint slice of positions. Lanes then return different\nresults by construction, with no runtime coordination.\n  At equal cost with four lanes (total candidate budget 64), on SIFT1M (1M SIFT\nfeature vectors) with Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs (HNSW)\nrecall@10 rises from 0.249 to 0.999 while lane overlap falls from nearly 100%\nto 0%. On MS MARCO (8.8M passages) with HNSW, hit@10 improves from 0.200 to\n0.601 and Mean Reciprocal Rank at 10 (MRR@10) from 0.133 to 0.330. For inverted\nfile (IVF) indexes we see smaller but consistent gains (for example, +11% on MS\nMARCO) by de-duplicating list routing. A microbenchmark shows planner overhead\nof ~37 microseconds per query (mean at the main setting) with linear growth in\nthe number of merged candidates.\n  These results yield a simple operational guideline: size the per-query pool\nto the total budget, deterministically partition positions across lanes, and\nturn redundant fan-out into complementary coverage without changing budget or\ndeadline.",

Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter\nawareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter\nsatisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent\npenalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and\nvector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that\nlearns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly\nfrom the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a\nconstrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect\nthe underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered\nANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and\nindex construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture\nthe underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-\nproves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible\nand generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.",

However, most recent\nreinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress\nexternal forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically\nrestricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme\nforces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a\nframework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking\npolicy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based\nformulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing\nagainst surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human\nmotion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across\nthe shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse\ninteraction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable\nforce thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,\nincluding gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object\nmanipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak\ncontact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more\nnatural interactions.

    "abstract": "Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing\nsource of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves\na 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website\nis available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and\nout-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual\nreasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such\nfailures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most\nexisting methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which\nrepresent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying\ndriving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates\nhuman input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our\nmethod leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from\nmulti-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to\nsynthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous\ncontrol. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it\nachieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject\nsurvey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with\narbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive\nbenchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and\nimprovement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy. Arbitration at\nthe level of semantic, language-based representations emerges as a design\nprinciple for shared autonomy, enabling systems to exercise common-sense\nreasoning and maintain continuity with human intent.",

However, current VLA models typically\ncontain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data\npretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as\nlimited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training\nparadigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language\nbackbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.\nIn this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces\ncomputation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong\nperformance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native\nmultimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated\ndiffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together\nforming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training\nparadigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the\nrepresentations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1\nachieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,\nsurpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also\nattains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO.

To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel algorithm, Temporal Action Selector (TAS),\nwhich caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and dynamically\nselects the optimal action through a lightweight selector network. TAS achieves\nbalanced optimization across three critical dimensions: reactivity, decision\nconsistency, and motion coherence. Experiments across multiple tasks with\ndiverse base policies show that TAS significantly improves success rates -\nyielding an absolute gain of up to 73.3%.

We introduce \\textit{ForeRobo}, a\ngenerative robotic agent that utilizes generative simulations to autonomously\nacquire manipulation skills driven by envisioned goal states. Instead of\ndirectly learning low-level policies, we advocate integrating generative\nparadigms with classical control. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a\nself-guided \\textit{propose-generate-learn-actuate} cycle. The agent first\nproposes the skills to be acquired and constructs the corresponding simulation\nenvironments; it then configures objects into appropriate arrangements to\ngenerate skill-consistent goal states (\\textit{ForeGen}). Subsequently, the\nvirtually infinite data produced by ForeGen are used to train the proposed\nstate generation model (\\textit{ForeFormer}), which establishes point-wise\ncorrespondences by predicting the 3D goal position of every point in the\ncurrent state, based on the scene state and task instructions. Finally,\nclassical control algorithms are employed to drive the robot in real-world\nenvironments to execute actions based on the envisioned goal states. Compared\nwith end-to-end policy learning methods, ForeFormer offers superior\ninterpretability and execution efficiency. We train and benchmark ForeFormer\nacross a variety of rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, and\nobserve an average improvement of 56.32\\% over the state-of-the-art state\ngeneration models, demonstrating strong generality across different\nmanipulation patterns.

    "abstract": "Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation, yet\nremains highly challenging in cluttered environments where occlusion, poor\nperception quality, and inconsistent 3D reconstructions often lead to unstable\nor failed grasps. Conventional pipelines have widely relied on RGB-D cameras to\nprovide geometric information, which fail on transparent or glossy objects and\ndegrade at close range. We present GraspView, an RGB-only robotic grasping\npipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without\ndepth sensors. Our framework integrates three key components: (i) global\nperception scene reconstruction, which provides locally consistent, up-to-scale\ngeometry from a single RGB view and fuses multi-view projections into a\ncoherent global 3D scene; (ii) a render-and-score active perception strategy,\nwhich dynamically selects next-best-views to reveal occluded regions; and (iii)\nan online metric alignment module that calibrates VGGT predictions against\nrobot kinematics to ensure physical scale consistency. Building on these\ntailor-designed modules, GraspView performs best-view global grasping, fusing\nmulti-view reconstructions and leveraging GraspNet for robust execution.\nExperiments on diverse tabletop objects demonstrate that GraspView\nsignificantly outperforms both RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially\nunder heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects. These\nresults highlight GraspView as a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D\npipelines, enabling reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments.",

While Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area\nsearch and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a\nsignificant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine\ncollaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an\nerror-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a\nlow-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,\nthis study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed\nframework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and\nmulti-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It\nthen employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,\nhierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This\nclosed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,\nproviding active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual\nmonitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR\ntask. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and\ncommand-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task\ncompletion time by approximately $64.2\\%$ and improved task success rate by\n$7\\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive\nworkload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\\%$. This work establishes the\npotential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm\ncollaborations in high-stakes scenarios.",

Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset\nenabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring.

    "abstract": "Food logging, both self-directed and prescribed, plays a critical role in\nuncovering correlations between diet, medical, fitness, and health outcomes.\nThrough conversations with nutritional experts and individuals who practice\ndietary tracking, we find current logging methods, such as handwritten and\napp-based journaling, are inflexible and result in low adherence and\npotentially inaccurate nutritional summaries. These findings, corroborated by\nprior literature, emphasize the urgent need for improved food logging methods.\nIn response, we propose SnappyMeal, an AI-powered dietary tracking system that\nleverages multimodal inputs to enable users to more flexibly log their food\nintake. SnappyMeal introduces goal-dependent follow-up questions to\nintelligently seek missing context from the user and information retrieval from\nuser grocery receipts and nutritional databases to improve accuracy. We\nevaluate SnappyMeal through publicly available nutrition benchmarks and a\nmulti-user, 3-week, in-the-wild deployment capturing over 500 logged food\ninstances. Users strongly praised the multiple available input methods and\nreported a strong perceived accuracy. These insights suggest that multimodal AI\nsystems can be leveraged to significantly improve dietary tracking flexibility\nand context-awareness, laying the groundwork for a new class of intelligent\nself-tracking applications.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used to draft and refactor code,\nbut code that works is not necessarily secure. We evaluate secure code\ngeneration using the Instruct Prime, which eliminated compliance-required\nprompts and cue contamination, and evaluate five instruction-tuned code LLMs\nusing a zero-shot baseline and a three-round reflexion prompting approach.\nSecurity is measured using the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), and results are\nreported by measuring Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics, considering the\nprogramming language and CWE family. Our findings show that insecurity remains\ncommon at the first round: roughly 25-33% of programs are insecure at a\nzero-shot baseline (t0 ). Weak cryptography/config-dependent bugs are the\nhardest to avoid while templated ones like XSS, code injection, and hard-coded\nsecrets are handled more reliably. Python yields the highest secure rates; C\nand C# are the lowest, with Java, JS, PHP, and C++ in the middle. Reflexion\nprompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from\n70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round\nfollowed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and\nNetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the\nbenefits.

In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific\nencoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP,\nenabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom\npre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs\nand combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve\ncode translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on\nloop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a\nwider semantic context.

    "abstract": "Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge\ndue to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert\nsupervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that\nincrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly\nlabels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method\nalternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample\nadmission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny\nconvolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible\ncomputational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset\nenabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during\nincremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is\nadmitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset\nlies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic\nuncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents\ndrift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or\nreplay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of\nnormality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.\nOn COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on\nPneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,\nROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211.

    "abstract": "Accurate geometric modeling of the aortic valve from 3D CT images is\nessential for biomechanical analysis and patient-specific simulations to assess\nvalve health or make a preoperative plan. However, it remains challenging to\ngenerate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across\ndifferent patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with\nirregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and\ninconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this\nwork, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline\nwith deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)\nmeshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing\naortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a\nuniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element\ncorrespondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the\nlearning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function\nwith only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness\nregularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and\nelement quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach\nproduces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and\nshape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to\nthe traditional methods. These results highlight that using structured quad\nmeshes for the template and neural network training not only ensures mesh\ncorrespondence and quality but also simplifies the training process, thus\nenhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of aortic valve modeling.",

Our\npolicy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe\nintra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy\ngeneralized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to\nvaried initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that\nthe model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in\nsimulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify\nlimitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will\nrequire additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent\nfeedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide\na foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic\nintra-operative spinal navigation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a\ncritical role in evaluating heart function and structure. Computed Tomography\n(CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate\ncardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow\nvelocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.\n  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved\nframework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.\n  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel\nbifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with\nvarying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings.\nWe compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed\nimages (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.\n  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by\navoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was\nrobust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower\nmean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow\nwas compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with\nshorter pulse widths.\n  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based\nflow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood\nflow assessment. The findings aim to inform future applications of PINNs to CT\nimages and provide a solution for image-based estimation, with reasonable\nacquisition parameters yielding accurate flow estimates.",

By linking behavioral\necology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated\napproaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily\nin the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to\nannotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic\nscene graphs.

    "abstract": "Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an\nopen-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from\nhallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap\nbetween their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks\nthat are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,\nwe build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With\nmore than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training\ndata to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by\ncognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking \"what's\nin common?\". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models\nspecifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that\nperceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning\nacross scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning\nmodels. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best\nperforming model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,\nconsisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,\nwe find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present\nin the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen\nduring training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide\nmodest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs\nshow bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer\npromise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the\nchallenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.",

    "abstract": "Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe\ndeployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally\nexpensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N\nsampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal\nalignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection\nSampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively\nsampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.\nThis allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly\nimproving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a\nsuite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\nby up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up\nto 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with\nstrong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided\nsampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional\nfine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic\ncharacteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic\nperformance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable\ninsights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,\ncontributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model\n(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.",

We examine\nopportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided\ncannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated\nsimulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We\ncurate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray\nsequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train\nimitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively\nalign a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled\nsetup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our\npolicy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe\nintra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy\ngeneralized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to\nvaried initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that\nthe model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in\nsimulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify\nlimitations, especially in entry point precision.

    "abstract": "Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the\nphysical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,\nresulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of\nAI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to\nautomate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical\nbottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of\nexplainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of\nthe tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for\nsample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs\na multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based\nagents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design\ngoals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the\ntarget goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation\nstrategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.\nThe AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity\nand is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from\npure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system\nlearns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate\nconvergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog\ndesign space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents\nserve as transparent design assistants.",

    "abstract": "Agents are now used widely in the process of software development, but\nbuilding production-ready software engineering agents is a complex task.\nDeploying software agents effectively requires flexibility in implementation\nand experimentation, reliable and secure execution, and interfaces for users to\ninteract with agents. In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent\nSDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these\ndesiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent\ncomponents of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents,\nwhich has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple\ninterface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the\ndefault case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents\nwith features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security\nand reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability,\nintegrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can\nconnect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS\nCode, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing\nSDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native\nsandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and\nbuilt-in security analysis. Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA\nbenchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Put together, these elements allow\nthe OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for\nprototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably\ndeploying agents at scale.",

We argue that parametric recalibration\nfunctions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple\ntheoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight\nmotivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard\ntemperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies\nin the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often\ncoupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff\ncan be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing\nand efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains\nover existing logistic-based calibration techniques. We provide efficient and\neasy-to-use open-source implementations of our methods, making them an\nattractive alternative to common temperature, vector, and matrix scaling\nimplementations.",

This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack\nthat infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet\nsize and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption\nprotecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to\nenable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs\nfrom major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC)\nand high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target\nratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive\ntopics like \"money laundering\" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations.\nThis industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under\nnetwork surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate\nthree mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet\ninjection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides\ncomplete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with\nproviders to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the\nneed for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle\nincreasingly sensitive information.",

    "abstract": "To foster trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union,\nthe AI Act requires providers to mark and detect the outputs of their\ngeneral-purpose models. The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods\nthat are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet,\nthe rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards\ncan be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses\nthis challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the\nmultiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct\nconcepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking\nCategorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods\naccording to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,\nduring, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2)\nWatermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping\neach criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and\ndetectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since\ninteroperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we\npropose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking\nComparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the\noperationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all\nfour standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further\nresearch into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture\nof LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across\nbenchmarks--from knowledge quizzes and math reasoning to web-agent tasks--but\nthese tests occur in static settings, lacking real dynamics and uncertainty.\nConsequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than\ndecision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce\nLiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in\nrealistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles:\n(i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on\noffline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing\nreal-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends\ncontrol from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk\nmanagement and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across\nstructurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction\nmarkets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each\nstep, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs\npercentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we\nrun 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1)\nhigh LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display\ndistinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and\n(3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These\nfindings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence,\nmotivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency\nunder live uncertainty.",

Our\nframework, called Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL), keeps every update\nphysically admissible by projecting network outputs onto the intersection of\nconstraint sets defined by conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and\npositivity. The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10%\ncomputational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We\nfurther stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small\noscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long\nprediction horizons. Together, these mechanisms eliminate both hard and soft\nviolations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth\nvanishes, and entropy and error remain bounded. On Burgers and Euler systems,\nCPL produces stable, physically lawful solutions without loss of accuracy.\nInstead of hoping neural solvers will respect physics, CPL makes that behavior\nan intrinsic property of the learning process.",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills by observing and\nreplicating the behavior of one or multiple experts. In recent years, advances\nin deep learning have significantly expanded the capabilities and scalability\nof imitation learning across a range of domains, where expert data can range\nfrom full state-action trajectories to partial observations or unlabeled\nsequences. Alongside this growth, novel approaches have emerged, with new\nmethodologies being developed to address longstanding challenges such as\ngeneralization, covariate shift, and demonstration quality. In this survey, we\nreview the latest advances in imitation learning research, highlighting recent\ntrends, methodological innovations, and practical applications. We propose a\nnovel taxonomy that is distinct from existing categorizations to better reflect\nthe current state of the IL research stratum and its trends. Throughout the\nsurvey, we critically examine the strengths, limitations, and evaluation\npractices of representative works, and we outline key challenges and open\ndirections for future research.",

Unlike traditional language models\nthat rely exclusively on distributed representations, our approach allows\ndynamic interpolation between highly interpretable localist encodings and\nefficient distributed representations without requiring model retraining. We\nconducted experiments on the WikiText corpus using a two-layer transformer\narchitecture, systematically varying the locality parameter {\\lambda} across\nthe full spectrum from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed). Our\nresults demonstrate that localist configurations achieve dramatically lower\nattention entropy, with {\\lambda} = 1.0 yielding 5.36 bits compared to 7.18\nbits at {\\lambda} = 0.0, while maintaining substantially higher pointer\nfidelity scores reflecting stronger alignment with rule-specified targets.\nPrediction experiments reveal that intermediate locality values optimize the\ntradeoff between interpretability and performance, with {\\lambda} = 0.6\nachieving test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%. These findings\nestablish that localist language models provide a practical framework for\napplications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability,\noffering precise mathematical control over the interpretability-performance\nspectrum through explicit penalty thresholds and information-theoretic design\nprinciples.",

The\nDCT-based parameterization provides a structured and decorrelated\nrepresentation that reveals the functional role of each neuron and allows\ndirect identification of redundant components. Leveraging this property, we\npropose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients\nwith negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across\nclassification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs\nachieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters.\nFurthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned,\nthanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis. Overall, these\nfindings demonstrate that the ENN framework offers a principled integration of\nsignal processing concepts into neural network design, achieving a balanced\ntrade-off between expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key\nresearch verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics,\nwith Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and\nenabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of\nthese verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper\nintroduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for\nanalyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through\nLLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain\nknowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting\nnatively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time\nseries data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2\nCLI tools (\"ros2 bag list\" or \"ros2 bag info\"), as well as the ability to\nfilter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP\nserver, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling\nwith different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source\n(through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling\ncapabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both\nproprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that\nthere is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude\nSonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that\nthere are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool\ndescription schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools\navailable to the models.

    "abstract": "As the \"agentic web\" takes shape-billions of AI agents (often LLM-powered)\nautonomously transacting and collaborating-trust shifts from human oversight to\nprotocol design. In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this\nshift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2),\nand Ethereum's ERC-8004 \"Trustless Agents,\" yet their underlying trust\nassumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of\ntrust models in inter-agent protocol design: Brief (self- or third-party\nverifiable claims), Claim (self-proclaimed capabilities and identity, e.g.\nAgentCard), Proof (cryptographic verification, including zero-knowledge proofs\nand trusted execution environment attestations), Stake (bonded collateral with\nslashing and insurance), Reputation (crowd feedback and graph-based trust\nsignals), and Constraint (sandboxing and capability bounding). For each, we\nanalyze assumptions, attack surfaces, and design trade-offs, with particular\nemphasis on LLM-specific fragilities-prompt injection,\nsycophancy/nudge-susceptibility, hallucination, deception, and\nmisalignment-that render purely reputational or claim-only approaches brittle.\nOur findings indicate no single mechanism suffices. We argue for\ntrustless-by-default architectures anchored in Proof and Stake to gate\nhigh-impact actions, augmented by Brief for identity and discovery and\nReputation overlays for flexibility and social signals. We comparatively\nevaluate A2A, AP2, ERC-8004 and related historical variations in academic\nresearch under metrics spanning security, privacy, latency/cost, and social\nrobustness (Sybil/collusion/whitewashing resistance). We conclude with hybrid\ntrust model recommendations that mitigate reputation gaming and misinformed LLM\nbehavior, and we distill actionable design guidelines for safer, interoperable,\nand scalable agent economies.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to\nsignificant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and\nCoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,\nknown as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these\nmodels often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While\ntraditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data\naugmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based\nmodifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely\nunexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,\nparticularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support\nand enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between\nthese augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to\nimprove generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such\nas CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that\nfocus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose\nAdding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces\nadversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations\nintroduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This\ndecoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually\ndiscriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently\noutperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and\ndomain generalization settings.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of open-access (OA) publications has intensified the\nchallenge of identifying relevant scientific papers. Due to privacy constraints\nand limited access to user interaction data, recent efforts have shifted toward\ncontent-based recommendation, which relies solely on textual information.\nHowever, existing models typically treat papers as unstructured text,\nneglecting their discourse organization and thereby limiting semantic\ncompleteness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose\nOMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective,\nMethod, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning,\nand structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style\nsummarization module converts raw papers into structured and\ndiscourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives\nalign semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels.\nThe final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through\ncontextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly\nconstructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in\nPrecision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that\nQA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete\nrepresentations. Overall, OMRC-MR provides a unified and interpretable\ncontent-based paradigm for scientific paper recommendation, advancing\ntrustworthy and privacy-aware scholarly information retrieval.",

While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the\nlimitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from\nthe source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that\nneural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with\nhuman judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the\nsource is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments\nbetween source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct\nthe first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular\nfocus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not\navailable. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual\nproxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and\nback-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch\nbetween synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried\nout on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with\ndiverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts\nconstitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word\nerror rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a\ncomputationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT\nmetrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled\nevaluation methodologies for speech translation.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a powerful technique to\nenhance the capabilities of Generative AI models by reducing hallucination.\nThus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhas sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in\nquestion-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance\nof four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat,\nFalcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA\ntasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation\nmetrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary\nquestions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini,\nalongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired\nwith RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its\nstatus as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's\nMistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary\nand long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b\nreports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas\nLLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research\nunderscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with\nproprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be\ninterconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from\nminimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality\nScale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine\nother psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing\nhuman psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from\nLLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >\n0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on\nsemantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms\ntrained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that\nLLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five\nresponses into natural language personality summaries through information\nselection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.\nSecond, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these\nsummaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality\nfactors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item\nimportance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely\nredundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to\noriginal scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,\nsecond-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs\ncan precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from\nminimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a\npowerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their\nemergent reasoning capabilities.",

However, while various\nprompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus\nprimarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This\nleaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more\ngeneral and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively\ninvestigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details\nand process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings\nreveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues\nand seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,\nwe propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions\n(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems\nwith an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various\nopen-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image\nbenchmarks.

The results revealed that, with\nrespect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable\ndecline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original\nunquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in\nsize, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the\npracticality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.",

Traditional\nmethods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this,\nwe formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework\nthat integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces\nspecialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine\ndesign candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the\naerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of\nthree key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems\nEngineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to\nconstruct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.\nThe Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical\nrequirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer\nleverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose\ncandidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and\nprovides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge\ngraph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the\nmanager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics\nsuch as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how\ncollaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can\nenhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of cislunar activities, including lunar landings, the Lunar\nGateway, and in-space refueling stations, requires advances in cost-efficient\ntrajectory design and reliable integration of navigation and remote sensing.\nTraditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high\npropellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no\ncoverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental\nawareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer\nstrategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel\nefficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic\nmissions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is\nhighlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition\nand digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables\nadaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and\ndecision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced\nPositioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation\ncapabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for\nmapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems\nsupport autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated\nsatellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable\nframework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic\npresence.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially influenced various software\nengineering tasks. Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional\nLLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code\nquality. However, these LLMs often rely on static, detailed instructions for\nspecific tasks. In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving\ncontexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and\nexecuting workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based\nagents in supporting refactoring activities. Specifically, we introduce\nRefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software\nrefactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning,\nexecuting, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection\nand tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java\nprojects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a\nsearch-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our\nassessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software\nquality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the\ncontribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that\nRefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a\nmedian of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a\nmedian of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and\nthe search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a\nmedian F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent\napproaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the\nmedian compilation success rate by 40.1%. These findings highlight the promise\nof multi-agent architectures in advancing automated software refactoring.",

Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while\nfailing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast,\npretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated\nstrong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their\npotential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally\ndifferent from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly\n(F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities\nthrough two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss\nthat fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous\ntime points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module\nthat retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on\nthem. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference\ntime, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates.\nBy combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap\nbetween robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction.\nExtensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones\nshow that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a\nscalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.",

The state variable satisfies a\ndiscrete diffusion law on a weighted, oriented graph, where conductances are\nscaled by edge lengths to preserve geometric fidelity. Boundary potentials act\nas controls that drive interior fluxes according to a linear network Laplacian.\nThe optimization problem enforces physically meaningful sign and flux-cap\nconstraints at all boundary edges, derived directly from a gradient bound. This\nyields a finite-dimensional LP whose feasible set is polyhedral, and whose\nboundedness and solvability follow from simple geometric or algebraic\nconditions on the network data.\n  We prove that under the absence of negative recession\ndirections--automatically satisfied in the presence of finite box bounds, flux\ncaps, or sign restrictions--the LP admits a global minimizer. Several\nsufficient conditions guaranteeing boundedness of the feasible region are\nidentified, covering both full-rank and rank-deficient flux maps. The analysis\nconnects classical results such as the Minkowski--Weyl decomposition, Hoffman's\nbound, and the fundamental theorem of linear programming with modern\nnetwork-based diffusion modeling.\n  Two large-scale examples illustrate the framework: (i) A typical large\nstadium in a major modern city, which forms a single connected component with\nrelatively uniform corridor widths, and a (ii) A complex street network\nemanating from a large, historical city center, which forms a multi-component\nsystem.",

    "abstract": "Designing materials with targeted properties remains challenging due to the\nvastness of chemical space and the scarcity of property-labeled data. While\nrecent advances in generative models offer a promising way for inverse design,\nmost approaches require large datasets and must be retrained for every new\ntarget property. Here, we introduce the EGMOF (Efficient Generation of MOFs), a\nhybrid diffusion-transformer framework that overcomes these limitations through\na modular, descriptor-mediated workflow. EGMOF decomposes inverse design into\ntwo steps: (1) a one-dimensional diffusion model (Prop2Desc) that maps desired\nproperties to chemically meaningful descriptors followed by (2) a transformer\nmodel (Desc2MOF) that generates structures from these descriptors. This modular\nhybrid design enables minimal retraining and maintains high accuracy even under\nsmall-data conditions. On a hydrogen uptake dataset, EGMOF achieved over 95%\nvalidity and 84% hit rate, representing significant improvements of up to 57%\nin validity and 14% in hit rate compared to existing methods, while remaining\neffective with only 1,000 training samples. Moreover, our model successfully\nperformed conditional generation across 29 diverse property datasets, including\nCoREMOF, QMOF, and text-mined experimental datasets, whereas previous models\nhave not. This work presents a data-efficient, generalizable approach to the\ninverse design of diverse MOFs and highlights the potential of modular inverse\ndesign workflows for broader materials discovery.",

The presented framework applies the CBF safety\nfilter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in\nthe generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this\nsafety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes\nwithout fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model\nregarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter\ndesign.

    "abstract": "Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of\nprocess steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and\nultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive\nhuman annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce\ndefects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable\nperformance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free\nframework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect\ndetection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information\nGuided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a\nlearnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to\ncoarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,\nwe introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages\nfocused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information\nGuided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided\nattention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student\nmodel. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background\ninterference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We\nvalidate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication\nstages and covering 15 defect types.

Our\nproposed augmentation overlap theory hinges on the insight that the support of\ndifferent intra-class samples will become more overlapped under aggressive data\naugmentations, thus simply aligning the positive samples (augmented views of\nthe same sample) could make contrastive learning cluster intra-class samples\ntogether. Moreover, from the newly derived augmentation overlap perspective, we\ndevelop an unsupervised metric for the representation evaluation of contrastive\nlearning, which aligns well with the downstream performance almost without\nrelying on additional modules.

We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to\nenforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative\ntrajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed\nmanifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising\nscores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This\nphysics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological\npriors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework.\nRigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a\nnew state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean\nSquare Deviation of 0.99 {\\AA} when superposing on the variable region, a 25%\nimprovement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest\nreported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored\nin the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers\nconsistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root\nMean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain\nAmino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%). By\naligning generative dynamics with physical laws, FP-AbDiff enhances robustness\nand generalizability, establishing a principled approach for physically\nfaithful and functionally viable antibody design.",

Our evaluation results\nreveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA\nmodels in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA\naccuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving\nliterature.

We proceed with correcting all the\nerrors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements,\nand present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements\nand proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to\nthe best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the\noriginal miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the\nautoformalization models and theorem provers.

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been\naccompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches,\ninherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on\nassumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with\nLLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to\nthe training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any\nspecific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing\nprinciple guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in\nhow these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based\nmonitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are\ngeneralist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across\nnumerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task\nindependently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model\ncapabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety\nguardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses,\nlong-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss.\nWe describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and\nprofessional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach.\nUltimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for\nsafe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist\nartificial intelligence models in healthcare.",

With\napplication domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management,\nco-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems.\nHowever, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under\nhigh-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency\nwhen addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these\nchallenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and\nsample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically\nrelevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we\nintroduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables\nDiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while\nsatisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.\nSecond, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the\nreinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts\nto evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.\nTogether, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when\nvalidated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including\nwarehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our\nmethod consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39%\nhigher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples.

Yet, the\nstatistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled,\ncausing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare\nsignals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,\ncreating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine\nthis gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods\noperating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;\nlocality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote\nefficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of\nself-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation\nspace around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these\nprinciples, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained\nwithin a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the\nlikelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,\nanomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms\nthat drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional\nproblems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion\ndetection, and generative-model validation.

    "abstract": "Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle\nhow movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,\nexisting methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it\nunclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based\napproaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit\nnature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based\nExplainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions\nthrough disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We\ndefine motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large\nlanguage model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an\nante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these\nconcepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101\n-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with\ncompetitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE\nthrough a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial\nfor model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.",

    "abstract": "Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as\nfacial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social\ninteraction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic\nrepresentations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups\nwithout explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.\nThese drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and\nintroduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social\ninteractions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware\nbottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction\ndetection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions\nusing body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first\ndetects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then\ninfers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based\nreasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social\ncues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.\nExperiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior\nmethods, achieving the new state of the art.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to\nsignificant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and\nCoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,\nknown as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these\nmodels often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While\ntraditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data\naugmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based\nmodifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely\nunexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,\nparticularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support\nand enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between\nthese augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to\nimprove generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such\nas CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that\nfocus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose\nAdding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces\nadversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations\nintroduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This\ndecoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually\ndiscriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently\noutperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and\ndomain generalization settings.

    "abstract": "Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source\naudio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization\nand insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose\nUniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is\nanchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two\nparallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent\nspace. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which\nenables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring\nprecise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore,\nthis cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module,\nwhich dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To\nenhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce\nModality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly\namplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint\nsynthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks\nwithin a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation,\nvideo-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive\nexperiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M),\nUniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre\nconsistency, and emotion consistency.",

In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can\nincrease the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.\nConsequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently\nsevere that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin\ngrows.

A first-order analysis yields a\nclosed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred\noutput is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,\nmodel-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks\nand adds only marginal computational overhead.

Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when\ncooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a\nstraightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key\nchallenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level\nfundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level\ndiscriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we\npropose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively\ndecouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative\nability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a\nlightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional\ndecomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order\nstatistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance\ntheir discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor\narchitecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss\nweights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial\ntraining phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of\ndiscriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of\nearly stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability\ntowards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively\ndecouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms\nof architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various\ndatasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms\nits counterparts when reducing computational cost.",

To\naddress this, this paper introduces \\ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data\ncollection as a closed-loop control problem. \\ac{FCDC} continuously\napproximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online\nprobabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on\nfeedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this\nfeedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and\nexploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from\naccumulating over time. Besides showcasing the controllability of \\ac{FCDC} on\na synthetic dataset, experiments on a real data stream show that \\ac{FCDC}\nproduces more balanced datasets by $\\SI{25.9}{\\percent}$ while reducing data\nstorage by $\\SI{39.8}{\\percent}$. These results demonstrate that data\ncollection itself can be actively controlled, transforming collection from a\npassive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the\ncore of data-centric AI.",

    "abstract": "Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or\ngenerative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield\nsoft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,\nwhen trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask\nconditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,\ndiffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real\nimage, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is\nused as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which\nmixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard\nmask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly\nbridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging\ndiversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned\nwith real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the\nmixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually\nre-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.\nAcross Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC\n2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and\nconsistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining\nlabel-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive\nre-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.",

Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason\non isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little\nsupport for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA\ndatasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We\nintroduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward\nlooking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and\n734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert\nannotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming\ninstrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video\nlanguage model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal\nCross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,\nwhile an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the\ntoken level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone\nto the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and\nEndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations\nshow that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame\nbudget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32\nframes slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a\ntemporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA\nadvances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.\nPitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and\nhighlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future\naware surgical assistance.",

We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation\nframework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation\nencoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB\nfeatures and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.\nTo efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient\nprojection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a\nSubsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient\nfine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing\nrepresentational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB\nand depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new\nLaparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.\nOn the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice\nSimilarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface\nDistance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,\nwe evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive\nperformance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating\nstrong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical\nenvironments.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage\nassessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed\noperationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and\nHelene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect\nimagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,\nteams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,\nrepresenting more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by\nsubject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.\nTo alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and\nmachine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed\nto automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state\nof practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has\nbeen confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice\nvia the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment\nwith sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known\ndataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage\nlabels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best\nperforming model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and\nHelene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.\nThis work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage\nassessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML\nresearch and user communities.",

We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free\nframework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect\ndetection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information\nGuided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a\nlearnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to\ncoarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,\nwe introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages\nfocused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information\nGuided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided\nattention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student\nmodel. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background\ninterference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We\nvalidate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication\nstages and covering 15 defect types.

    "abstract": "In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,\nobserving patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates\ntimely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view\nsynthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely\ncaptured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting\ntheir practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three\nsparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,\nrendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity\nof input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of\ncamera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D\nreconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a\nprior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,\nfollowed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training\nefficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely\nsparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric\nconstraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering\nfidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950\nclinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to\nsimulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and\nachieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion\nvisualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.",

    "abstract": "To foster trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union,\nthe AI Act requires providers to mark and detect the outputs of their\ngeneral-purpose models. The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods\nthat are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet,\nthe rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards\ncan be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses\nthis challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the\nmultiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct\nconcepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking\nCategorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods\naccording to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,\nduring, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2)\nWatermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping\neach criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and\ndetectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since\ninteroperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we\npropose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking\nComparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the\noperationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all\nfour standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further\nresearch into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture\nof LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward\nunseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design.",

At each\nstep, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs\npercentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we\nrun 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1)\nhigh LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display\ndistinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and\n(3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These\nfindings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence,\nmotivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency\nunder live uncertainty.",

Studies have shown that\nwhen human children learn language, they consistently favor hypotheses based on\nhierarchical syntactic rules without ever encountering disambiguating examples.\nA recent line of work has inquired as to whether common neural network\narchitectures share this bias, finding that they do so only under special\nconditions: when syntactically supervised, when pre-trained on massive corpora,\nor when trained long past convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the\nfirst time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in\nhuman-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements:\nstack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer,\nsimple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack\nof Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed\nby DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic\nstacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question\nformation task. We also propose a modification to the stack RNN architecture\nthat improves hierarchical generalization. These results suggest that\nstack-augmented neural networks may be more accurate models of human language\nacquisition than standard architectures, serving as useful objects of\npsycholinguistic study.

However, during\nmemory storage and retrieval, these systems frequently exhibit memory\nhallucinations, including fabrication, errors, conflicts, and omissions.\nExisting evaluations of memory hallucinations are primarily end-to-end question\nanswering, which makes it difficult to localize the operational stage within\nthe memory system where hallucinations arise. To address this, we introduce the\nHallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level\nhallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines\nthree evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question\nanswering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different\noperational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct\nuser-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and\nHaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type\nquestions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns,\nwith context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations\nacross different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based\non HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate\nhallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently\npropagate errors to the question answering stage. Future research should focus\non developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that\nsystematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.",

Large language models (LLMs) struggle with this task, frequently\nfailing to interpret user intent (misinterpretation) or unnecessarily altering\nthe original question's structure (over-correction). We propose QuestionRAG, a\nframework that tackles these problems. To address misinterpretation, it\nenriches the input with external knowledge (e.g., search results, related\nentities). To prevent over-correction, it uses reinforcement learning (RL) to\nalign the model's objective with precise correction, not just paraphrasing. Our\nresults demonstrate that knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding\nfaulty questions. Furthermore, RL-based alignment proves significantly more\neffective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), boosting the model's\nability to follow instructions and generalize. By integrating these two\nstrategies, QuestionRAG unlocks the full potential of LLMs for the question\ncorrection task.",

This work investigates BPE segmentation recipes\nacross various data volumes and language pairs to evaluate MT system\nperformance. We find that utilizing asymmetric BPE, where the source and target\nlanguages have different NMOs, significantly improves results over the\nsymmetric approach, especially in low-resource settings (50K, 100K, and 500K\nsentence pairs). Specifically, asymmetric BPE yield statistically significant\n($p<0.05$) average gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ on English-Hindi in\nlow-resource setups. We validated this trend across six additional language\npairs (English and Telugu, Shona, Norwegian, Kyrgyz, Hausa, and Inuktitut),\nobserving statistically significant improvement in 10 out of 12 systems\ncompared to symmetric BPE.

This study\nuses a novel text-based approach to measure the idea-level diffusion of social\nscience knowledge from the research domain to the journalism and policy-making\ndomains. By doing so, we expand the detection of knowledge diffusion beyond the\nmeasurements of direct references. Our study focuses on media effects theories\nas key research ideas in the field of communication science. Using 72,703\ndocuments (2000-2019) from three domains (i.e., research, journalism, and\npolicy-making) that mention these ideas, we count the mentions of these ideas\nin each domain, estimate their domain-specific contexts, and track and compare\ndifferences across domains and over time. Overall, we find that diffusion\npatterns and dynamics vary considerably between ideas, with some ideas\ndiffusing between other domains, while others do not. Based on the embedding\nregression approach, we compare contextualized meanings across domains and find\nthat the distances between research and policy are typically larger than\nbetween research and journalism. We also find that ideas largely shift roles\nacross domains - from being the theories themselves in research to sense-making\nin news to applied, administrative use in policy. Over time, we observe\nsemantic convergence mainly for ideas that are practically oriented.

While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative,\nthey suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing\nemotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This\npaper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability\ngap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates\ngame theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional\nstates online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs\nwith the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating\nconflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent\nsimulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial\ndebtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show\nthat a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt\nrecovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its\nsize. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles\nto dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints.\nBesides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw\nmodel scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation,\npaving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators\nthat can operate on the edge.",

However, evaluating the fairness\nof models is a complex challenge, and approaches that do so typically utilize\nstandard question-answer (QA) styled schemes. Such methods often overlook\ndeeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive\nfairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work,\nwe introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences\nencoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by\nsafety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases\noften relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which\npresent limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with\nadditional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to\nuncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals\nduring QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects,\npresenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future\ndevelopment of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment\ntraining.

While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the\nlimitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from\nthe source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that\nneural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with\nhuman judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the\nsource is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments\nbetween source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct\nthe first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular\nfocus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not\navailable. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual\nproxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and\nback-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch\nbetween synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried\nout on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with\ndiverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts\nconstitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word\nerror rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a\ncomputationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT\nmetrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled\nevaluation methodologies for speech translation.",

    "abstract": "We revisit continual pre-training for large language models and argue that\nprogress now depends more on scaling the right structure than on scaling\nparameters alone. We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that\ninserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all\npre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies\nand increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original\nfunctionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation,\nwhich maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented\ninitialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative\nAdaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to\nacquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as\nSCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and\nSCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing\nbetween preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography\nbenchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion\nwhile still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean\ncorpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and\ncompetitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best\noverall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when\npreservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and\nadaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning\nsetups.",

Yet, existing multimodal benchmarks either\noveremphasize textual reasoning or fall short of systematically capturing\nvision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving the cognitive capacity of MLLMs\ninsufficiently assessed. To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC\n(Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded\nbenchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three\nfundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and\nknowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs'\ncognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct\nextensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that\nclosed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs.\n30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak\n(less than or equal to 30%). We further identify common error patterns,\nincluding orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and\npoor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that\nChain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason ->\nverify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language\nmodels (LLMs) by leveraging a control barrier function (CBF) to ensure\nuser-desirable text generation. The presented framework applies the CBF safety\nfilter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in\nthe generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this\nsafety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes\nwithout fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model\nregarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter\ndesign. The overall text-generation system is implemented with open-source\nlanguage models, aiming to generate positive text.",

We present CARMA, the first\nautomatically annotated large-scale dataset of Arabic Reddit posts.

We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of\nlexical and semantic differences between users, providing insights into the\nlinguistic markers of specific mental health conditions.

To stabilize training, these methods\ntypically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each\nprompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),\nreducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.\n  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages\nfor each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we\npropose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt\nmeans to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --\nparticularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we\nconstruct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance\npolicy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a\ndrop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no\nadditional hyper-parameters or computation.

    "abstract": "We study batched nonparametric contextual bandits under a margin condition\nwhen the margin parameter $\\alpha$ is unknown. To capture the statistical price\nof this ignorance, we introduce the regret inflation criterion, defined as the\nratio between the regret of an adaptive algorithm and that of an oracle knowing\n$\\alpha$. We show that the optimal regret inflation grows polynomial with the\nhorizon $T$, with exponent precisely given by the value of a convex\noptimization problem involving the dimension, smoothness, and batch budget.\nMoreover, the minimizers of this optimization problem directly prescribe the\nbatch allocation and exploration strategy of a rate-optimal algorithm. Building\non this principle, we develop RoBIN (RObust batched algorithm with adaptive\nBINning), which achieves the optimal regret inflation up to logarithmic\nfactors. These results reveal a new adaptivity barrier: under batching,\nadaptation to an unknown margin parameter inevitably incurs a polynomial\npenalty, sharply characterized by a variational problem. Remarkably, this\nbarrier vanishes when the number of batches exceeds $\\log \\log T$; with only a\ndoubly logarithmic number of updates, one can recover the oracle regret rate up\nto polylogarithmic factors.",

Furthermore, the lack of\nexplainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of\nthe tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for\nsample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs\na multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based\nagents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design\ngoals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the\ntarget goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation\nstrategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.\nThe AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity\nand is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from\npure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system\nlearns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate\nconvergence.

The key idea is to leverage an implicit\nbehavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency\nsignal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that\n(i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is\nhigh, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online\nexperience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation\nfrom out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and\naccelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ\nconsistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving\nfaster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance.

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) grading is a critical prognostic factor but remains\nhampered by inter-observer variability and the privacy constraints of\nmulti-institutional data sharing. While deep learning offers a path to\nautomation, centralized training models conflict with data governance\nregulations and neglect the diagnostic importance of multi-scale analysis. In\nthis work, we propose a scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning (FL)\nframework for CRC histopathological grading that integrates multi-scale feature\nlearning within a distributed training paradigm. Our approach employs a\ndual-stream ResNetRS50 backbone to concurrently capture fine-grained nuclear\ndetail and broader tissue-level context. This architecture is integrated into a\nrobust FL system stabilized using FedProx to mitigate client drift across\nheterogeneous data distributions from multiple hospitals. Extensive evaluation\non the CRC-HGD dataset demonstrates that our framework achieves an overall\naccuracy of 83.5%, outperforming a comparable centralized model (81.6%).\nCrucially, the system excels in identifying the most aggressive Grade III\ntumors with a high recall of 87.5%, a key clinical priority to prevent\ndangerous false negatives. Performance further improves with higher\nmagnification, reaching 88.0% accuracy at 40x. These results validate that our\nfederated multi-scale approach not only preserves patient privacy but also\nenhances model performance and generalization.

    "abstract": "In this work, we perform a simulation-based forecasting analysis to compare\nthe constraining power of two higher-order summary statistics of the\nlarge-scale structure (LSS), the Minkowski Functionals (MFs) and the\nConditional Moments of Derivative (CMD), with a particular focus on their\nsensitivity to nonlinear and anisotropic features in redshift-space. Our\nanalysis relies on halo catalogs from the Big Sobol Sequence(BSQ) simulations\nat redshift $z=0.5$, employing a likelihood-free inference framework\nimplemented via neural posterior estimation. At the fiducial cosmology of the\nQuijote simulations $(\\Omega_{m}=0.3175,\\,\\sigma_{8}=0.834)$, and for the\nsmoothing scale $R=15\\,h^{-1}$Mpc, we find that the CMD yields tighter\nforecasts for $(\\Omega_{m}},\\,\\sigma_{8})$ than the zeroth- to third-order MFs\ncomponents, improving the constraint precision by ${\\sim}(44\\%,\\,52\\%)$,\n${\\sim}(30\\%,\\,45\\%)$, ${\\sim}(27\\%,\\,17\\%)$, and ${\\sim}(26\\%,\\,17\\%)$,\nrespectively. A joint configuration combining the MFs and CMD further enhances\nthe precision by approximately ${\\sim}27\\%$ compared to the standard MFs alone,\nhighlighting the complementary anisotropy-sensitive information captured by the\nCMD in contrast to the scalar morphological content encapsulated by the MFs. We\nfurther extend the forecasting analysis to a continuous range of cosmological\nparameter values and multiple smoothing scales. Our results show that, although\nthe absolute forecast uncertainty for each component of summary statistics\ndepends on the underlying parameter values and the adopted smoothing scale, the\nrelative constraining power among the summary statistics remains nearly\nconstant throughout.",

    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward\nunseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design.",

Traditional\nbeamforming techniques such as zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE) beamforming experience performance deterioration under\nadverse channel conditions. Deep learning-based beamforming offers an\nalternative with nonlinear mappings from channel state information (CSI) to\nbeamforming weights by improving robustness against dynamic channel\nenvironments. Transformer-based models are particularly effective due to their\nability to model long-range dependencies across time and frequency. However,\ntheir quadratic attention complexity limits scalability in large OFDM grids.\nRecent studies address this issue through sparse attention mechanisms that\nreduce complexity while maintaining expressiveness, yet often employ patterns\nthat disregard channel dynamics, as they are not specifically designed for\nwireless communication scenarios. In this work, we propose a Doppler-aware\nSparse Neural Network Beamforming (Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF) model that\nincorporates a channel-adaptive sparse attention mechanism in a multi-user\nsingle-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) setting. The proposed sparsity structure\nis configurable along 2D time-frequency axes based on channel dynamics and is\ntheoretically proven to ensure full connectivity within p hops, where p is the\nnumber of attention heads. Simulation results under urban macro (UMa) channel\nconditions show that Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF significantly outperforms both a\nfixed-pattern baseline, referred to as Standard Sparse NNBF, and conventional\nbeamforming techniques ZFBF and MMSE beamforming in high mobility scenarios,\nwhile maintaining structured sparsity with a controlled number of attended keys\nper query.",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action\ndemonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements\nseverely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide\nonly state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is\noften suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation\nreinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining\ndeep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from\nobservation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation\nQ-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs\nexpert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence\nmechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.\nThis enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training\nwhile maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further\nextend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to\ntackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a\nchallenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.\nHA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging\nprocedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to\nexpert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns\ncompared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit\nimitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous\naction settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging\nexpert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter\nsensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset\nsizes and hyperparameter configurations.",

    "abstract": "Despite ongoing theoretical research on cross-validation (CV), many\ntheoretical questions about CV remain widely open. This motivates our\ninvestigation into how properties of algorithm-distribution pairs can affect\nthe choice for the number of folds in $k$-fold cross-validation.\n  Our results consist of a novel decomposition of the mean-squared error of\ncross-validation for risk estimation, which explicitly captures the\ncorrelations of error estimates across overlapping folds and includes a novel\nalgorithmic stability notion, squared loss stability, that is considerably\nweaker than the typically required hypothesis stability in other comparable\nworks.\n  Furthermore, we prove:\n  1. For every learning algorithm that minimizes empirical error, a minimax\nlower bound on the mean-squared error of $k$-fold CV estimating the population\nrisk $L_\\mathcal{D}$: \\[ \\min_{k \\mid n}\\; \\max_{\\mathcal{D}}\\;\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\big(\\widehat{L}_{\\mathrm{CV}}^{(k)} -\nL_{\\mathcal{D}}\\big)^{2}\\right] \\;=\\; \\Omega\\!\\big(\\sqrt{k}/n\\big), \\] where\n$n$ is the sample size and $k$ the number of folds. This shows that even under\nidealized conditions, for large values of $k$, CV cannot attain the optimum of\norder $1/n$ achievable by a validation set of size $n$, reflecting an inherent\npenalty caused by dependence between folds.\n  2. Complementing this, we exhibit learning rules for which \\[\n  \\max_{\\mathcal{D}}\\; \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\big(\\widehat{L}_{\\mathrm{CV}}^{(k)} -\nL_{\\mathcal{D}}\\big)^{2}\\right] \\;=\\; \\Omega(k/n), \\] matching (up to\nconstants) the accuracy of a hold-out estimator of a single fold of size $n/k$.\n  Together these results delineate the fundamental trade-off in\nresampling-based risk estimation: CV cannot fully exploit all $n$ samples for\nunbiased risk evaluation, and its minimax performance is pinned between the\n$k/n$ and $\\sqrt{k}/n$ regimes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the generalization behavior of learning algorithms is a central\ngoal of learning theory. A recently emerging explanation is that learning\nalgorithms are successful in practice because they converge to flat minima,\nwhich have been consistently associated with improved generalization\nperformance. In this work, we study the link between flat minima and\ngeneralization in the canonical setting of stochastic convex optimization with\na non-negative, $\\beta$-smooth objective. Our first finding is that, even in\nthis fundamental and well-studied setting, flat empirical minima may incur\ntrivial $\\Omega(1)$ population risk while sharp minima generalizes optimally.\nThen, we show that this poor generalization behavior extends to two natural\n''sharpness-aware'' algorithms originally proposed by Foret et al. (2021),\ndesigned to bias optimization toward flat solutions: Sharpness-Aware Gradient\nDescent (SA-GD) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). For SA-GD, which\nperforms gradient steps on the maximal loss in a predefined neighborhood, we\nprove that while it successfully converges to a flat minimum at a fast rate,\nthe population risk of the solution can still be as large as $\\Omega(1)$,\nindicating that even flat minima found algorithmically using a sharpness-aware\ngradient method might generalize poorly. For SAM, a computationally efficient\napproximation of SA-GD based on normalized ascent steps, we show that although\nit minimizes the empirical loss, it may converge to a sharp minimum and also\nincur population risk $\\Omega(1)$. Finally, we establish population risk upper\nbounds for both SA-GD and SAM using algorithmic stability techniques.",

Experimental results across\nclassification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs\nachieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters.\nFurthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned,\nthanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis.

Here, we study data curation strategies\nwhere an imperfect oracle selects the training examples according to their\ndifficulty and correctness. Our results provide exact scaling law curves for\ntest error under both label-agnostic and label-aware curation rules, revealing\nwhen and why keeping only a subset of data can improve generalization. In\ncontrast to classical scaling laws, we show that under certain conditions,\nsmall curated datasets can outperform full datasets, and we provide analytical\nconditions for this by deriving precise phase transition curves tied to data\nsize and quality. We validate these theoretical claims with empirical results\non ImageNet, confirming our predictions about when curation improves accuracy\nand can even mitigate model collapse.

Guided by this insight, we propose a\nsupport-set algorithm preserving strictly the feasibility of iterates.

We establish the global\nconvergence of the support-set algorithm to a first-order stationary point, and\nshow that its iteration complexity required to reach an $\\epsilon$-approximate\nfirst-order stationary point is $O (\\epsilon^{-2})$.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to\nsignificant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and\nCoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,\nknown as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these\nmodels often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While\ntraditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data\naugmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based\nmodifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely\nunexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,\nparticularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support\nand enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between\nthese augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to\nimprove generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such\nas CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that\nfocus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose\nAdding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces\nadversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations\nintroduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This\ndecoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually\ndiscriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently\noutperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and\ndomain generalization settings.

    "abstract": "In this study, a modular, data-free pipeline for multi-label intention\nrecognition is proposed for agentic AI applications in transportation. Unlike\ntraditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora\nand often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach\neliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of\nmulti-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named\nDMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different\ntransport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to\nobtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using\na novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and\nmaximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline\nis demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation\ncontext. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%\nand an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers\nand recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that\nSentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over\nalternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%\ngain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system\nseamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information,\ntraffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation\ndomain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents\nwithout costly manual labelling.",

However, because finding the optimal tree is NP-hard,\nenumerating the Rashomon set is inherently challenging. Therefore, we introduce\nSORTD, a novel framework that improves scalability and enumerates trees in the\nRashomon set in order of the objective value, thus offering anytime behavior.\nOur experiments show that SORTD reduces runtime by up to two orders of\nmagnitude compared with the state of the art. Moreover, SORTD can compute\nRashomon sets for any separable and totally ordered objective and supports\npost-evaluating the set using other separable (and partially ordered)\nobjectives.

There are several\nfactors, along with data dimensionality reduction methods, that worsen this\nproblem, such as characteristics of the datasets, classical to quantum\ninformation embedding methods, percentage of feature reduction, classical\ncomponents associated with quantum models, and structure of quantum machine\nlearning models. We consistently observed the difference in the accuracy range\nof 14% to 48% amongst these models, using data reduction and not using it.\nApart from this, our observations have shown that some data reduction methods\ntend to perform better for some specific data embedding methodologies and\nansatz constructions.",

On\nthis basis, gated recurrent units are introduced to model the temporal\nevolution of call chains, and multi-layer stacking and concatenation operations\nare used to jointly obtain structural and temporal representations, improving\nthe ability to identify anomaly patterns. Furthermore, anomaly scoring\nfunctions at both the node and path levels are defined to achieve unified\nmodeling from local anomaly detection to global call chain tracing, which\nenables the identification of abnormal service nodes and the reconstruction of\npotential anomaly propagation paths. Sensitivity experiments are then designed\nfrom multiple dimensions, including hyperparameters, environmental\ndisturbances, and data distribution, to evaluate the framework, and results\nshow that it outperforms baseline methods in key metrics such as AUC, ACC,\nRecall, and F1-Score, maintaining high accuracy and stability under dynamic\ntopologies and complex environments.

Traditional rate limiting algorithms,\nsuch as token bucket and sliding window, while widely adopted, struggle to\nadapt to dynamic traffic patterns and varying system loads. This paper proposes\nan adaptive rate limiting strategy based on deep reinforcement learning that\ndynamically balances system throughput and service latency. We design a hybrid\narchitecture combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage\nActor-Critic (A3C) algorithms, modeling the rate limiting decision process as a\nMarkov Decision Process. The system continuously monitors microservice states\nand learns optimal rate limiting policies through environmental interaction.\nExtensive experiments conducted in a Kubernetes cluster environment demonstrate\nthat our approach achieves 23.7% throughput improvement and 31.4% P99 latency\nreduction compared to traditional fixed-threshold strategies under high-load\nscenarios. Results from a 90-day production deployment handling 500 million\ndaily requests validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method,\nwith 82% reduction in service degradation incidents and 68% decrease in manual\ninterventions.",

Artificial Neural Network models, a machine learning\ntool, were employed to assess the relative importance of these predictors and\nto identify hotspots of endemism.

Existing deep learning approaches either require extensive\nlabeled datasets or are limited to specific measurement types, often leading to\nfailure in such regimes and restricting their practical applicability. Here, a\nnovel generative neural operator framework, IGNO, is introduced to overcome\nthese limitations. IGNO unifies the solution of inverse problems from both\npoint measurements and operator-valued data without labeled training pairs.\nThis framework encodes high-dimensional, potentially discontinuous coefficient\nfields into a low-dimensional latent space, which drives neural operator\ndecoders to reconstruct both coefficients and PDE solutions. Training relies\npurely on physics constraints through PDE residuals, while inversion proceeds\nvia efficient gradient-based optimization in latent space, accelerated by an a\npriori normalizing flow model. Across a diverse set of challenging inverse\nproblems, including recovery of discontinuous coefficients from solution-based\nmeasurements and the EIT problem with operator-based measurements, IGNO\nconsistently achieves accurate, stable, and scalable inversion even under\nsevere noise. It consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method under\nvarying noise levels and demonstrates strong generalization to\nout-of-distribution targets.

However, while various\nprompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus\nprimarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This\nleaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more\ngeneral and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively\ninvestigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details\nand process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings\nreveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues\nand seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,\nwe propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions\n(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems\nwith an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various\nopen-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image\nbenchmarks.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, but\nthey remain vulnerable to memorization -- reproducing training data rather than\ngenerating novel outputs. This not only limits their creative potential but\nalso raises concerns about privacy and safety. While empirical studies have\nexplored mitigation strategies, theoretical understanding of memorization\nremains limited. We address this gap through developing a dual-separation\nresult via two complementary perspectives: statistical estimation and network\napproximation. From the estimation side, we show that the ground-truth score\nfunction does not minimize the empirical denoising loss, creating a separation\nthat drives memorization. From the approximation side, we prove that\nimplementing the empirical score function requires network size to scale with\nsample size, spelling a separation compared to the more compact network\nrepresentation of the ground-truth score function. Guided by these insights, we\ndevelop a pruning-based method that reduces memorization while maintaining\ngeneration quality in diffusion transformers.",

However, their computational intensity restricts\ndeployment on resource-constrained IoT devices, creating a critical need for\nlightweight detection models. A common solution to this challenge is model\ncompression via quantization. This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework\nwhere an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors\nderived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a\npretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization\nstrategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization\n(PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection\nperformance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT\nbotnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with\nrespect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable\ndecline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original\nunquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in\nsize, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the\npracticality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.",

It\nis essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various\ninformation from multiple modalities. The main challenge is how to\nappropriately align and fuse the representations of different modalities into a\njoint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the\nKronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities\nand indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the\njoint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is\nunderexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the\ninteractions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution\nand marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel\ncopula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the\njoint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions\namong them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align\nthe marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a\nGaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint\ndistribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing\nmodalities. Extensive experiments on public MIMIC datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our model over other competitors. The code is available\nat https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CMCM.",

However, current methods\noften overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on\nincreasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the\ndistance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --\nparticularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across\nvarying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is\nessential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a\nframework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key\nidea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space,\nthereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By\ncapturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse\nperiods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We\nfurther show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream\ntasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill\ndiscovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's\nrepertoire.

Retraining LLMs from scratch to\nreflect such changes is computationally expensive, making model editing a\npromising lightweight alternative that updates only a small subset of\nparameters. Despite its potential, it remains unclear whether model editing\nyields genuine syntactic and semantic adaptations or merely superficial fixes.\nIn this work, we present a systematic study of five state-of-the-art model\nediting methods: Constrained Fine-Tuning (FT), GRACE, MEMIT, PMET, and ROME. We\napply these methods to three leading open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama,\nCodeQwen1.5, and DeepSeek-Coder, under controlled API deprecation scenarios.\nOur evaluation covers both instant and sequential editing settings, using three\ndisjoint evaluation sets designed to assess reliability, generalization, and\nspecificity. We measure model correctness at three levels: successful\ncompilation, partial test case pass, and full test pass. Our findings show that\ninstant edits consistently degrade model performance, with syntactic validity\ndropping by up to 86 percentage points and functional correctness declining by\n45 points even in the best-performing setting. Sequential edits further amplify\nthis degradation, and in some cases, model performance collapses entirely.\nAcross all models, most passing generations relied on workarounds rather than\ncorrectly adopting the intended changes, while faulty adoptions that result in\ntest failures or compilation errors were significantly more frequent.

Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains\ndifficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the\nneed for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the\ntask of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem\ninvolving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.\nSuccess is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly\nwrapped package with clean folds and no tears.\n  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task\nplanner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid\nimitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is\na Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from\nhuman demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal\ndependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike\nvanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short\ntasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal\ngrounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process\nand supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than\nmerely replicating motion sequences.\n  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks.

    "abstract": "The ability of existing headway distributions to accurately reflect the\ndiverse behaviors and characteristics in heterogeneous traffic (different types\nof vehicles) and mixed traffic (human-driven vehicles with autonomous vehicles)\nis limited, leading to unsatisfactory goodness of fit. To address these issues,\nwe modified the exponential function to obtain a novel headway distribution.\nRather than employing Euler's number (e) as the base of the exponential\nfunction, we utilized a real number base to provide greater flexibility in\nmodeling the observed headway. However, the proposed is not a probability\nfunction. We normalize it to calculate the probability and derive the\nclosed-form equation. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive experiment\nwith five open datasets: highD, exiD, NGSIM, Waymo, and Lyft to evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed distribution and compared its performance with six\nexisting distributions under mixed and heterogeneous traffic flow. The results\nrevealed that the proposed distribution not only captures the fundamental\ncharacteristics of headway distribution but also provides physically meaningful\nparameters that describe the distribution shape of observed headways. Under\nheterogeneous flow on highways (i.e., uninterrupted traffic flow), the proposed\ndistribution outperforms other candidate distributions. Under urban road\nconditions (i.e., interrupted traffic flow), including heterogeneous and mixed\ntraffic, the proposed distribution still achieves decent results.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting anomalies (anomaly prediction) in multivariate time series from\ndifferent real-world, dynamic, and complex systems is vital for preempting\ncritical failures, leading to a substantial minimization in operational costs\nand human labor. Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while\nfailing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast,\npretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated\nstrong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their\npotential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally\ndifferent from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly\n(F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities\nthrough two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss\nthat fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous\ntime points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module\nthat retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on\nthem. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference\ntime, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates.\nBy combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap\nbetween robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction.\nExtensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones\nshow that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a\nscalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.",

However, conventional\napproaches typically rely on prior knowledge of the target domain or require\nmodel retraining, limiting their practicality in dynamic or\nresource-constrained environments. Recent test-time adaptation methods based on\nbatch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but\nthey often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained\nto specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration\n(AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation\ndistributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the\nfull shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures\nemploying BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of\nestimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a\nrobust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our\nmethod leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling\nunsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C,\nCIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR\nachieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing\ntest-time adaptation baselines.

    "abstract": "Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have become a powerful representation\nfor geometric reconstruction from point clouds, yet they often require both\ngradient- and curvature-based regularization to suppress spurious warp and\npreserve structural fidelity. FlatCAD introduced the Off-Diagonal Weingarten\n(ODW) loss as an efficient second-order prior for CAD surfaces, approximating\nfull-Hessian regularization at roughly half the computational cost. However,\nFlatCAD applies a fixed ODW weight throughout training, which is suboptimal:\nstrong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail\nrecovery in later stages. We present scheduling strategies for the ODW loss\nthat assign a high initial weight to stabilize optimization and progressively\ndecay it to permit fine-scale refinement. We investigate constant, linear,\nquintic, and step interpolation schedules, as well as an increasing warm-up\nvariant.

    "abstract": "Designing materials with targeted properties remains challenging due to the\nvastness of chemical space and the scarcity of property-labeled data. While\nrecent advances in generative models offer a promising way for inverse design,\nmost approaches require large datasets and must be retrained for every new\ntarget property. Here, we introduce the EGMOF (Efficient Generation of MOFs), a\nhybrid diffusion-transformer framework that overcomes these limitations through\na modular, descriptor-mediated workflow. EGMOF decomposes inverse design into\ntwo steps: (1) a one-dimensional diffusion model (Prop2Desc) that maps desired\nproperties to chemically meaningful descriptors followed by (2) a transformer\nmodel (Desc2MOF) that generates structures from these descriptors. This modular\nhybrid design enables minimal retraining and maintains high accuracy even under\nsmall-data conditions. On a hydrogen uptake dataset, EGMOF achieved over 95%\nvalidity and 84% hit rate, representing significant improvements of up to 57%\nin validity and 14% in hit rate compared to existing methods, while remaining\neffective with only 1,000 training samples. Moreover, our model successfully\nperformed conditional generation across 29 diverse property datasets, including\nCoREMOF, QMOF, and text-mined experimental datasets, whereas previous models\nhave not. This work presents a data-efficient, generalizable approach to the\ninverse design of diverse MOFs and highlights the potential of modular inverse\ndesign workflows for broader materials discovery.",

    "abstract": "Software aging is a phenomenon that affects long-running systems, leading to\nprogressive performance degradation and increasing the risk of failures. To\nmitigate this problem, this work proposes an adaptive approach based on machine\nlearning for software aging detection in environments subject to dynamic\nworkload conditions. We evaluate and compare a static model with adaptive\nmodels that incorporate adaptive detectors, specifically the Drift Detection\nMethod (DDM) and Adaptive Windowing (ADWIN), originally developed for concept\ndrift scenarios and applied in this work to handle workload shifts. Experiments\nwith simulated sudden, gradual, and recurring workload transitions show that\nstatic models suffer a notable performance drop when applied to unseen workload\nprofiles, whereas the adaptive model with ADWIN maintains high accuracy,\nachieving an F1-Score above 0.93 in all analyzed scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and\nenvironment configurations in search of improved system performance. With\napplication domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management,\nco-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems.\nHowever, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under\nhigh-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency\nwhen addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these\nchallenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and\nsample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically\nrelevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we\nintroduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables\nDiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while\nsatisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.\nSecond, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the\nreinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts\nto evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.\nTogether, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when\nvalidated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including\nwarehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our\nmethod consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39%\nhigher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This\nsets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone\ntowards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.",

    "abstract": "Modern artificial intelligence has revolutionized our ability to extract rich\nand versatile data representations across scientific disciplines. Yet, the\nstatistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled,\ncausing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare\nsignals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,\ncreating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine\nthis gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods\noperating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;\nlocality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote\nefficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of\nself-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation\nspace around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these\nprinciples, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained\nwithin a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the\nlikelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,\nanomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms\nthat drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional\nproblems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion\ndetection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the\nnatural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing\nonly a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous\nlocations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring\nboth the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have improved\ndiagnostic capabilities in healthcare, yet limited interpretability continues\nto hinder clinical adoption. Schizophrenia, a complex disorder with diverse\nsymptoms including disorganized speech and social withdrawal, demands tools\nthat capture symptom severity and provide clinically meaningful insights beyond\nbinary diagnosis. Here, we present an interpretable framework that leverages\narticulatory speech features through eigenspectra difference plots and a\nweighted sum with exponential decay (WSED) to quantify vocal tract\ncoordination. Eigenspectra plots effectively distinguished complex from simpler\ncoordination patterns, and WSED scores reliably separated these groups, with\nambiguity confined to a narrow range near zero. Importantly, WSED scores\ncorrelated not only with overall BPRS severity but also with the balance\nbetween positive and negative symptoms, reflecting more complex coordination in\nsubjects with pronounced positive symptoms and the opposite trend for stronger\nnegative symptoms. This approach offers a transparent, severity-sensitive\nbiomarker for schizophrenia, advancing the potential for clinically\ninterpretable speech-based assessment tools.",

The framework's modular design enables the integration of any\ncomponent, from embeddings and deep networks to custom modules, into classic\nclick models for end-to-end optimization. We demonstrate CLAX's efficiency by\nrunning experiments on the full Baidu-ULTR dataset comprising over a billion\nuser sessions in $\\approx$ 2 hours on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster\nthan traditional EM approaches.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of open-access (OA) publications has intensified the\nchallenge of identifying relevant scientific papers. Due to privacy constraints\nand limited access to user interaction data, recent efforts have shifted toward\ncontent-based recommendation, which relies solely on textual information.\nHowever, existing models typically treat papers as unstructured text,\nneglecting their discourse organization and thereby limiting semantic\ncompleteness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose\nOMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective,\nMethod, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning,\nand structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style\nsummarization module converts raw papers into structured and\ndiscourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives\nalign semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels.\nThe final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through\ncontextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly\nconstructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in\nPrecision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that\nQA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete\nrepresentations. Overall, OMRC-MR provides a unified and interpretable\ncontent-based paradigm for scientific paper recommendation, advancing\ntrustworthy and privacy-aware scholarly information retrieval.",

    "abstract": "The oracle problem refers to the inability of an agent to know if the\ninformation coming from an oracle is authentic and unbiased. In ancient times,\nphilosophers and historians debated on how to evaluate, increase, and secure\nthe reliability of oracle predictions, particularly those from Delphi, which\npertained to matters of state. Today, we refer to data carriers for automatic\nmachines as oracles, but establishing a secure channel between these oracles\nand the real world still represents a challenge. Despite numerous efforts, this\nproblem remains mostly unsolved, and the recent advent of blockchain oracles\nhas added a layer of complexity because of the decentralization of blockchains.\nThis paper conceptually connects Delphic and modern blockchain oracles,\ndeveloping a comparative framework. Leveraging blockchain oracle taxonomy,\nlexical analysis is also performed on 167 Delphic queries to shed light on the\nrelationship between oracle answer quality and question type. The presented\nframework aims first at revealing commonalities between classical and\ncomputational oracles and then at enriching the oracle analysis within each\nfield. This study contributes to the computer science literature by proposing\nstrategies to improve the reliability of blockchain oracles based on insights\nfrom Delphi and to classical literature by introducing a framework that can\nalso be applied to interpret and classify other ancient oracular mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems in multi-behavior domains, such as advertising and\ne-commerce, aim to guide users toward high-value but inherently sparse\nconversions. Leveraging auxiliary behaviors (e.g., clicks, likes, shares) is\ntherefore essential. Recent progress on generative recommendations has brought\nnew possibilities for multi-behavior sequential recommendation. However,\nexisting generative approaches face two significant challenges: 1) Inadequate\nSequence Modeling: capture the complex, cross-level dependencies within user\nbehavior sequences, and 2) Lack of Suitable Datasets: publicly available\nmulti-behavior recommendation datasets are almost exclusively derived from\ne-commerce platforms, limiting the validation of feasibility in other domains,\nwhile also lacking sufficient side information for semantic ID generation. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel generative framework, GAMER\n(Generative Augmentation and Multi-lEvel behavior modeling for Recommendation),\nbuilt upon a decoder-only backbone. GAMER introduces a cross-level interaction\nlayer to capture hierarchical dependencies among behaviors and a sequential\naugmentation strategy that enhances robustness in training. To further advance\nthis direction, we collect and release ShortVideoAD, a large-scale\nmulti-behavior dataset from a mainstream short-video platform, which differs\nfundamentally from existing e-commerce datasets and provides pretrained\nsemantic IDs for research on generative methods. Extensive experiments show\nthat GAMER consistently outperforms both discriminative and generative\nbaselines across multiple metrics.",

    "abstract": "Safe multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) under task-induced constraints is a\ncritical challenge in robotics. Many real-world scenarios require robots to\nnavigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by\ntasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding\ncollisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in\ndecentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold\nconstraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a\nmanifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for\ndecentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints\nto capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a\ndecentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate\nmotion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions\nabout other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse\nmanifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional\nmulti-agent manipulation problems. Experiments show that our method outperforms\nexisting constrained motion planners and operates at speeds suitable for\nreal-world applications.

Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically\nassumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates\nboth users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment,\nallowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts.\nPreferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose\nstrength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's\nproperties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic\ncase study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting\npreferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment\ntask. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base\nscores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and\ncontextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and\ncontext-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work\nadvances the field of multi-user HRI.

The egocentric indicator\nof deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased\naccuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive\nload remained low.

    "abstract": "Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key\nresearch verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics,\nwith Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and\nenabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of\nthese verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper\nintroduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for\nanalyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through\nLLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain\nknowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting\nnatively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time\nseries data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2\nCLI tools (\"ros2 bag list\" or \"ros2 bag info\"), as well as the ability to\nfilter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP\nserver, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling\nwith different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source\n(through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling\ncapabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both\nproprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that\nthere is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude\nSonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that\nthere are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool\ndescription schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools\navailable to the models.

    "abstract": "The human hand plays a vital role in daily life and industrial applications,\nyet replicating its multifunctional capabilities-including motion, sensing, and\ncoordinated manipulation-with robotic systems remains a formidable challenge.\nDeveloping a dexterous robotic hand requires balancing human-like agility with\nengineering constraints such as complexity, size-to-weight ratio, durability,\nand force-sensing performance. This letter presents Dex-Hand 021, a\nhigh-performance, cable-driven five-finger robotic hand with 12 active and 7\npassive degrees of freedom (DoFs), achieving 19 DoFs dexterity in a lightweight\n1 kg design. We propose a proprioceptive force-sensing-based admittance control\nmethod to enhance manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate its superior\nperformance: a single-finger load capacity exceeding 10 N, fingertip\nrepeatability under 0.001 m, and force estimation errors below 0.2 N. Compared\nto PID control, joint torques in multi-object grasping are reduced by 31.19%,\nsignificantly improves force-sensing capability while preventing overload\nduring collisions. The hand excels in both power and precision grasps,\nsuccessfully executing 33 GRASP taxonomy motions and complex manipulation\ntasks. This work advances the design of lightweight, industrial-grade dexterous\nhands and enhances proprioceptive control, contributing to robotic manipulation\nand intelligent manufacturing.",

Despite its widespread effects,\nadequate support or treatment for social anxiety is often insufficient.\nAdvances in technology, particularly in social robotics, offer promising\nopportunities to complement traditional mental health. As an initial step\ntoward developing effective solutions, it is essential to understand the values\nthat shape what is considered meaningful, acceptable, and helpful. In this\nstudy, a participatory design workshop was conducted with mental health\nacademic researchers to elicit the underlying values that should inform the\ndesign of socially assistive robots for social anxiety support.

The findings reveal rich insights into design-relevant\nvalues-including adaptivity, acceptance, and efficacy-that are core to support\nfor individuals with social anxiety.

However, they often\nlack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing\nthem entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss\nof accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a\nlightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance\nfrom foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs\na fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual\ninstructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance\nembeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space,\nallowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief,\ntargeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language\nmodel-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence\nis low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves\nrelevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions.\nExtensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse\npolicy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task\nsuccess rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that\nGUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping.\nOverall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade,\nrather than replace, validated robot policies.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn\ndiverse behaviors without relying on external rewards. However, current methods\noften overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on\nincreasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the\ndistance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --\nparticularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across\nvarying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is\nessential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a\nframework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key\nidea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space,\nthereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By\ncapturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse\nperiods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We\nfurther show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream\ntasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill\ndiscovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's\nrepertoire.

    "abstract": "Human-robot cooperation is essential in environments such as warehouses and\nretail stores, where workers frequently handle deformable objects like paper,\nbags, and fabrics. Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains\ndifficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the\nneed for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the\ntask of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem\ninvolving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.\nSuccess is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly\nwrapped package with clean folds and no tears.\n  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task\nplanner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid\nimitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is\na Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from\nhuman demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal\ndependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike\nvanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short\ntasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal\ngrounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process\nand supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than\nmerely replicating motion sequences.\n  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We\nshow that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized\nmodels, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level\nintent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object\nmanipulation.",

This limits autonomy and environmental\nawareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer\nstrategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel\nefficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic\nmissions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is\nhighlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition\nand digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables\nadaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and\ndecision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced\nPositioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation\ncapabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for\nmapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems\nsupport autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated\nsatellite swarm operations.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various\nscientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications.\nDespite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order\nto achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this\ncontext is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or\nfalse answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic\nknowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what\nis the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,\nclassical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight\nfundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,\nchallenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we\ndevelop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating\nwhether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world\npopulations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social\nbehavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not\nseem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the\ncontext of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that\nlanguage models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer\n1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional\n(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also\nlimited.",

    "abstract": "Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet\nare inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema\nmapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for\nindividual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental\nlimitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning\npatterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a\nmulti-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition\ninto specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,\nand reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent\ncontexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits\npersist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%\ndiscovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning\nenhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%\nfor analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide\nwhen and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while\nenabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring the internal temperature and humidity of shipping containers is\nessential to preventing quality degradation during cargo transportation.\nSensorless monitoring -- machine learning models that predict the internal\nconditions of the containers using exogenous factors -- shows promise as an\nalternative to monitoring using sensors. However, it does not incorporate\ntelemetry information and correct for systematic errors, causing the\npredictions to differ significantly from the live data and confusing the users.\nIn this paper, we introduce the residual correction method, a general framework\nfor correcting for systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live\ntelemetry data. We call this class of models ``adaptive-sensorless''\nmonitoring. We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48\nmillion data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever\nused in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements\nover the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the\nsimulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\\sim$\n2.31$^\\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\\sim$\n7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root\nmean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\\sim$ 3.26$^\\circ$C for temperature (vs\n3.38$^\\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs\n10.0% by sensorless).

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved remarkable success across\nvarious downstream tasks, but such gains are largely driven by scaling up on\ntraining data. Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated\ntraining examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally\npresent in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and\nsocial recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human\nencodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware\nLanguage-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive\nloss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring\nentities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a\nlarge-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling\nstructured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that\nSLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification\ntasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational\nsupervision for cross-modal alignment.",

AI control offers one approach to\nmitigating the risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring their actions and\nintervening or auditing when necessary. Evaluating the safety of these\nprotocols requires understanding both their effectiveness against current\nattacks and their robustness to adaptive adversaries. In this work, we\nsystematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset\nof diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols,\nincluding deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical\nactions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for\nincrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety\nfrom 50% to 96%. We then iterate on red team strategies against these protocols\nand find that attack policies with additional affordances, such as knowledge of\nwhen resampling occurs or the ability to simulate monitors, can substantially\nimprove attack success rates against our resampling strategy, decreasing safety\nto 17%. However, deferring on critical actions is highly robust to even our\nstrongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack\npolicies access to protocol internals.",

    "abstract": "The design and application of LLM-based personas in AI companionship is a\nrapidly expanding but fragmented field, spanning from virtual emotional\ncompanions and game NPCs to embodied functional robots. This diversity in\nobjectives, modality, and technical stacks creates an urgent need for a unified\nframework. To address this gap, this paper systematizes the field by proposing\na Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI companion applications. The framework\nis structured along two critical axes: Virtual vs. Embodied and Emotional\nCompanionship vs. Functional Augmentation. Quadrant I (Virtual Companionship)\nexplores virtual idols, romantic companions, and story characters, introducing\na four-layer technical framework to analyze their challenges in maintaining\nlong-term emotional consistency. Quadrant II (Functional Virtual Assistants)\nanalyzes AI applications in work, gaming, and mental health, highlighting the\nshift from \"feeling\" to \"thinking and acting\" and pinpointing key technologies\nlike enterprise RAG and on-device inference. Quadrants III & IV (Embodied\nIntelligence) shift from the virtual to the physical world, analyzing home\nrobots and vertical-domain assistants, revealing core challenges in symbol\ngrounding, data privacy, and ethical liability. This taxonomy provides not only\na systematic map for researchers and developers to navigate the complex persona\ndesign space but also a basis for policymakers to identify and address the\nunique risks inherent in different application scenarios.",

Traditional exploration strategies that rely on random\nlocal policy noise, such as $\\epsilon$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration\nmethods, often struggle to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation. In\nthis paper, we integrate the notion of (expected) value of information (EVOI)\nwithin the well-known Bootstrapped DQN algorithmic framework, to enhance the\nalgorithm's deep exploration ability. Specifically, we develop two novel\nalgorithms that incorporate the expected gain from learning the value of\ninformation into Bootstrapped DQN. Our methods use value of information\nestimates to measure the discrepancies of opinions among distinct network\nheads, and drive exploration towards areas with the most potential. We evaluate\nour algorithms with respect to performance and their ability to exploit\ninherent uncertainty arising from random network initialization. Our\nexperiments in complex, sparse-reward Atari games demonstrate increased\nperformance, all the while making better use of uncertainty, and, importantly,\nwithout introducing extra hyperparameters.",

    "abstract": "A common challenge for decision makers is selecting actions whose rewards are\nunknown and evolve over time based on prior policies. For instance, repeated\nuse may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may\nrestore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or\nGaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world\nsettings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can\ncompute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not\nprovide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting\nthe ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of\nparticular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in\ndeveloping just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level\neffects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In\nthis paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored\nto the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.\nWe then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization\nand population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret\nand minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning\nphysical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our\nmethods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high\nstatistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly\nincreasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while\naccounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs,\nour framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with\nstatistical validity.",

We propose generative hints, a\ntraining methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire\ninput space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training\nset to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which\nwe refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce\nfunctional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the\ntraining dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised\nmanner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled\nvirtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across\ndatasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently\noutperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property.

    "abstract": "Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature\nsearch, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been\nmade towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such\nagents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing\ncoherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,\nan AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended\nobjective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of\nparallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before\nsynthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos\nuses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis\nagent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to\ncoherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively\nexecuting an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.\nKosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,\nensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of\nstatements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a\nsingle 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own\nresearch time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number\nof valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles\n(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that\nspan metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.\nThree discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or\nunpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four\nmake novel contributions to the scientific literature.",

The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages\narchitectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for\nperformance, calibration, and fairness.

In this study, we present a novel label-efficient\napproach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated\nreference image patches with self-supervised deep learning. We use the\n\"Bootstrap Your Own Latent\" pre-training strategy with a large amount of\nunlabeled color-infrared aerial images (377,921 256x256 1-m pixel patches) to\npre-train a ResNet-101 convolutional encoder.

Existing\napproaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising\nspatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose\nSCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework\nthat integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical\nstructure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g.,\nradiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally\nconsistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision,\ndemonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation,\nand classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains\nwithout further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of\nthe art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval,\nimproves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and\nBERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an\nout-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the\ncross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.",

Since comprehensive\nconventional physical testing is impractical due to cost and safety concerns,\nVirtual Testing Environments (VTE) can be adopted as an alternative. Comparing\nVTE-generated sensor outputs against their real-world analogues can be a strong\nindication that the VTE accurately represents reality. Correspondingly, this\nwork explores a comprehensive experimental approach to finding evaluation\nmetrics suitable for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans. The\nmetrics were tested in terms of sensitivity and accuracy with different noise,\ndensity, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. From comparing\nthe metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best\nacross all cases. In the second step of the research, a Virtual Testing\nEnvironment was generated using real LiDAR scan data. The data was collected in\na controlled environment with only static objects using an instrumented vehicle\nequipped with LiDAR, IMU and cameras. Simulated LiDAR scans were generated from\nthe VTEs using the same pose as real LiDAR scans. The simulated and LiDAR scans\nwere compared in terms of model perception and geometric similarity. Actual and\nsimulated LiDAR scans have a similar semantic segmentation output with a mIoU\nof 21\\% with corrected intensity and an average density aware chamfer distance\n(DCD) of 0.63. This indicates a slight difference in the geometric properties\nof simulated and real LiDAR scans and a significant difference between model\noutputs.

Domain adaptation\nchallenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive\nin-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas.\nMoreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly\nrigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent\nthe performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through\nthree contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text\nSimilarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates\nrealistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation\nwith traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present\nthe first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs;\n<7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education\nreview ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and\nweight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask\nfine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling\n1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark\nresults with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first\npublic set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in\nlow-resource domains.",

As this\nproblem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,\nadvancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions\nthat reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic\nscenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to\nlearn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,\ndegrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment\nbetween the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for\neffective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and\nvision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.\nThis shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D\nscenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address\nthis, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse\ntools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate\nalignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed\ninstructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world\nenvironments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge\nby 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with\nLEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods.\nAcross all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in\ngenerating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.",

    "abstract": "Online learning to rank (OLTR) studies how to recommend a short ranked list\nof items from a large pool and improves future rankings based on user clicks.\nThis setting is commonly modeled as cascading bandits, where the objective is\nto maximize the likelihood that the user clicks on at least one of the\npresented items across as many timesteps as possible. However, such systems are\nvulnerable to click fraud and other manipulations (i.e., corruption), where\nbots or paid click farms inject corrupted feedback that misleads the learning\nprocess and degrades user experience. In this paper, we propose MSUCB, a robust\nalgorithm that incorporates a novel mean-of-medians estimator, which to our\nknowledge is applied to bandits with corruption setting for the first time.\nThis estimator behaves like a standard mean in the absence of corruption, so no\ncost is paid for robustness. Under corruption, the median step filters out\noutliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value.\nUpdating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence\nin experiments. Hence, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the absence\nof corruption and degrades gracefully under corruptions, with regret increasing\nonly by an additive term tied to the total corruption. Comprehensive and\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets further demonstrate that our\napproach consistently outperforms prior methods while maintaining strong\nrobustness. In particular, it achieves a \\(97.35\\%\\) and a \\(91.60\\%\\) regret\nimprovement over two state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various\nscientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications.\nDespite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order\nto achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this\ncontext is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or\nfalse answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic\nknowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what\nis the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,\nclassical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight\nfundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,\nchallenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we\ndevelop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating\nwhether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world\npopulations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social\nbehavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not\nseem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the\ncontext of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that\nlanguage models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer\n1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional\n(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also\nlimited.",

    "abstract": "In the era of AI-driven science and engineering, we often want to design\ndiscrete objects in silico according to user-specified properties. For example,\nwe may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a\ncircuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific\napplications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over\ndesign variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective\noptimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may\nonly loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve\nmaximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are\nunable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and\ndemonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm,\nDecomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any\ndecomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make\noptimization more efficient. At its core, DADO employs a soft-factorized\n\"search distribution\" -- a learned generative model -- for efficient navigation\nof the search space, invoking graph message-passing to coordinate optimization\nacross linked factors.",

Since comprehensive\nconventional physical testing is impractical due to cost and safety concerns,\nVirtual Testing Environments (VTE) can be adopted as an alternative.

Correspondingly, this\nwork explores a comprehensive experimental approach to finding evaluation\nmetrics suitable for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans. The\nmetrics were tested in terms of sensitivity and accuracy with different noise,\ndensity, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. From comparing\nthe metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best\nacross all cases. In the second step of the research, a Virtual Testing\nEnvironment was generated using real LiDAR scan data. The data was collected in\na controlled environment with only static objects using an instrumented vehicle\nequipped with LiDAR, IMU and cameras. Simulated LiDAR scans were generated from\nthe VTEs using the same pose as real LiDAR scans. The simulated and LiDAR scans\nwere compared in terms of model perception and geometric similarity. Actual and\nsimulated LiDAR scans have a similar semantic segmentation output with a mIoU\nof 21\\% with corrected intensity and an average density aware chamfer distance\n(DCD) of 0.63. This indicates a slight difference in the geometric properties\nof simulated and real LiDAR scans and a significant difference between model\noutputs. During the comparison, density-aware chamfer distance was found to be\nthe most correlated among the metrics with perception methods.",

Unlike on-road applications,\nagricultural automation integrates driving and working processes, each of which\nimposes distinct operational constraints. Handling this complexity and ensuring\nconsistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a\nstructured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However,\nexisting Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique\nchallenges of agricultural applications.\n  Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework,\nwhich can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of\nautonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core\nelements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured\nmethod for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters\nusing concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model\nderived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process\nlayer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative\nverification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical\nscenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness\nand consistency.\n  Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating\nunambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD. Demonstrative use cases show how the Ag-ODD\nFramework can support the standardization and scalability of environmental\ndescriptions for autonomous agricultural systems.",

    "abstract": "As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models\neffectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully\ndesigned long-context evaluations have recently been released, these\nevaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,\nwhich allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This\nrepresents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We\nintroduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require\nanalyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating\nthese analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two\ntask sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can\neasily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a\ndownstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational\ndata. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to\nperform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over\ntemporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with\nGPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy\non both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong\nto enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities\nof text.",

    "abstract": "Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM\ncontext, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,\nresulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the\ncurrent turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This\ntrade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,\nwe propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact\nmemory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses\nthe user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform\nsearch actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for\nsolving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn\ninteractions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize\nthis workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that\njointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of\nMemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of\ntrajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level\nadvantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as\nSearch-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines\non seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher\neven outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance\nbetween information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and\nlower computational overhead.

Meeting the objectives depends on modeling\nchoices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional\ngenerative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input\nrepresentation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE\n(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),\na scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an\nautoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like\nmolecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The\nlatent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property\npredictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the\nlatent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:\n(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on\nSELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable\nformulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with\nlow-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation\nwith limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,\nour approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal\nsmooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional\nexploration and property-aware generation.

At the same\ntime, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior\nwork has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if\ninference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer\nsolutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we\nintroduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.\nWe demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads\ncan all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that\nhad been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter\n-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper\nintroduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked\ntogether with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and\nsemantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache\nlocality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can\nenable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we\ndemonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two\ndistinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be\noptimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called\nlost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span\nquery on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock\ninference server using an 8b model.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision\nsystems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to\nexplain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works\nsuggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be\nattributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance\npropagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find\nimages that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are\nlargely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered\nconcepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting\nthe accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.\n  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept\nRelevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a\nmultimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive\nnames to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that\ntranslate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To\nensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the\nsemantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and\nexplanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,\noffering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries\nfor non-technical stakeholders.\n  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a\nVGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution\nmethods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to\ninterpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI\nsystems.",

The success of these systems will\ncritically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,\neven under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical\nstudies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a\ncollaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative\ncapabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable\nautomated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving\necological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and\nclosed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our\nresults reveal a \"collaboration gap\": models that perform well solo often\ndegrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break\ndown dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well\nalone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting\nwith the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a \"relay inference\"\napproach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,\nclosing much of the gap.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse\napplications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning capabilities\nthrough transformer architectures with attention mechanisms. However,\ntransformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention\nmodule (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which\nseverely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is\ncritical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under\nhigh request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.\n  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with\nlinear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent\ncomputation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we\nintroduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer\nattention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.\nThese models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained\nreasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing\nless critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.\n  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with\ndifferent SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as\nmore Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant\nof Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,\nachieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the\nproduction-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning\nperformance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can\ndeliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent\nwithout substantially compromising the reasoning quality.",

To address these, we propose Federated Attention\n(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention\nmechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and\ncomputational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local\nself-attention over their own token representations while periodically\nexchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer\nblocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private\nprompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual\nrepresentation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across\nprivate data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight\nprovides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated\noptimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this\nframework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within\nparticipants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error\npropagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the\nfundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation\nefficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of\nparticipants.

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising paradigm for tackling\ncomputational problems that challenge classical AI. Yet, the inherent\nprobabilistic behavior of quantum mechanics, device noise in NISQ hardware, and\nhybrid quantum-classical execution pipelines introduce new risks that prevent\nreliable deployment of QML in real-world, safety-critical settings. This\nresearch offers a broad roadmap for Trustworthy Quantum Machine Learning\n(TQML), integrating three foundational pillars of reliability: (i) uncertainty\nquantification for calibrated and risk-aware decision making, (ii) adversarial\nrobustness against classical and quantum-native threat models, and (iii)\nprivacy preservation in distributed and delegated quantum learning scenarios.\nWe formalize quantum-specific trust metrics grounded in quantum information\ntheory, including a variance-based decomposition of predictive uncertainty,\ntrace-distance-bounded robustness, and differential privacy for hybrid learning\nchannels. To demonstrate feasibility on current NISQ devices, we validate a\nunified trust assessment pipeline on parameterized quantum classifiers,\nuncovering correlations between uncertainty and prediction risk, an asymmetry\nin attack vulnerability between classical and quantum state perturbations, and\nprivacy-utility trade-offs driven by shot noise and quantum channel noise. This\nroadmap seeks to define trustworthiness as a first-class design objective for\nquantum AI.",

    "abstract": "Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in\neducation, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge\nTracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational\nquestions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing\nKT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill\ntags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important\nsource of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while\nlimiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing\n(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using\npretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories\nand question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in\nboth behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves\nperformance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better\nto cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of\nquestion content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained\nrepresentations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.",

To address this, we introduce the\nTraining-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a\nnovel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,\nNoise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent\nrepresentations from both foreground and composite generation processes,\ntransplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures\nsemantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite\nlayers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring\nfine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our\ntraining-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,\nenhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and\nfidelity.

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced\nby out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms\ntypically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically\ncategorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show\nthat each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints\ntend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,\nthough least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior\npolicy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint\nthat restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of\nneighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds\nextrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also\napproximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.\nMoreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism\nby adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ\ndata quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood\nconstraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop\na simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning\n(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.\nEmpirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL\nbenchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited\ndata.",

By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual\ncortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary\ncognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the\nextraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing\nsubject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike\nconventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and\nheavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\\% accuracy on average yet generates\neach reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast\nand clinically scalable solution.

The combined representation is then\nprocessed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and\nidentifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong\npotential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage\nAlzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in\nthe field.",

    "abstract": "Existing wireless video transmission schemes directly conduct video coding in\npixel level, while neglecting the inner semantics contained in videos. In this\npaper, we propose a wireless video semantic communication framework with\ndecoupled diffusion multi-frame compensation (DDMFC), abbreviated as WVSC-D,\nwhich integrates the idea of semantic communication into wireless video\ntransmission scenarios. WVSC-D first encodes original video frames as semantic\nframes and then conducts video coding based on such compact representations,\nenabling the video coding in semantic level rather than pixel level. Moreover,\nto further reduce the communication overhead, a reference semantic frame is\nintroduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in common video coding\nmethods. At the receiver, DDMFC is proposed to generate compensated current\nsemantic frame by a two-stage conditional diffusion process. With both the\nreference frame transmission and DDMFC frame compensation, the bandwidth\nefficiency improves with satisfying video transmission performance.\nExperimental results verify the performance gain of WVSC-D over other DL-based\nmethods e.g. DVSC about 1.8 dB in terms of PSNR.",

    "abstract": "Accurately forecasting central bank policy decisions, particularly those of\nthe Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC) has become increasingly important amid\nheightened economic uncertainty. While prior studies have used monetary policy\ntexts to predict rate changes, most rely on static classification models that\noverlook the deliberative nature of policymaking. This study proposes a novel\nframework that structurally imitates the FOMC's collective decision-making\nprocess by modeling multiple large language models(LLMs) as interacting agents.\nEach agent begins with a distinct initial belief and produces a prediction\nbased on both qualitative policy texts and quantitative macroeconomic\nindicators. Through iterative rounds, agents revise their predictions by\nobserving the outputs of others, simulating deliberation and consensus\nformation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a latent variable\nrepresenting each agent's underlying belief(e.g., hawkish or dovish), and we\ntheoretically demonstrate how this belief mediates the perception of input\ninformation and interaction dynamics. Empirical results show that this\ndebate-based approach significantly outperforms standard LLMs-based baselines\nin prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit modeling of beliefs provides\ninsights into how individual perspectives and social influence shape collective\npolicy forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated great\npotential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models\n(LLMs), achieving remarkable progress in domains such as mathematics and\nprogramming where standard answers are available. However, for open-ended tasks\nlacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction\nfollowing), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,\nthereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a\nkey question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended\ntasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the\nopen domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose\nthe existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended\ntasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice\nReformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended\ndata into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even\nin the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM\nperformance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,\nour VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the\nbaseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for\nrepresentation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as\nTransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent\nlimitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.\nIn this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model\nthat challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a\ncompact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear\nSpherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as\na hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments\non three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate\nthat SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean\ncounterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237\nand CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We\nprovide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing\nthat this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to\ncomprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,\nwe prove that the spherical geometry creates an \"inherently hard negative\nsampling\" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the\nmodel to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our\nfindings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an\nimplementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for\ngeometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful\nand stable KGE models.",

To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical\ntask-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable\nsubgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled\nby an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the\ntree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent\nnodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent\nnode retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and\nshares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on\nthe WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently\noutperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.\nNotably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5\n72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.",

However, despite these advancements, current\nmodels often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially\nwhen dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in\nbiomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM\narchitecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound\nrecordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the\nH-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.\nExtensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a\npublic benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed\nmodel achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a\ntest accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.",

Current studies have\nproposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation\nfor embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by\nleveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly\ntrained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,\nshowing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial\nembedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for\nsome queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal\nenvironments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal\nmultimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

Causal inference, which focuses on\ndetermining the directionality and strength of interactions between variables\nrather than merely relying on correlations, is considered a logical approach\nfor inferring biological networks. Existing methods for causal structure\ninference typically assume that causal relationships between variables can be\nrepresented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, this assumption is at\nodds with the reality of widespread feedback loops in biological systems,\nmaking these methods unsuitable for direct use in biological network inference.\nIn this study, we propose a new framework named SCALD (Structural CAusal model\nfor Loop Diagram), which employs a nonlinear structure equation model and a\nstable feedback loop conditional constraint through continuous optimization to\ninfer causal regulatory relationships under feedback loops. We observe that\nSCALD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring both transcriptional\nregulatory networks and signaling transduction networks. SCALD has\nirreplaceable advantages in identifying feedback regulation. Through\ntranscription factor (TF) perturbation data analysis, we further validate the\naccuracy and sensitivity of SCALD. Additionally, SCALD facilitates the\ndiscovery of previously unknown regulatory relationships, which we have\nsubsequently confirmed through ChIP-seq data analysis. Furthermore, by\nutilizing SCALD, we infer the key driver genes that facilitate the\ntransformation from colon inflammation to cancer by examining the dynamic\nchanges within regulatory networks during the process.",

In order to\nunderstand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as\nexpected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries\nto probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple\nLLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts.

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when\ndifferent modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term\nmodality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative\nuncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality\nfollowing, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into\nhow MLLMs resolve conflicting information.",

    "abstract": "Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible\nlearning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the\nStructurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel\ncomputational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the\nmorphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates\non a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local\nprediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning\nmechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the\ntemporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned\nexpectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically\nmigrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This\ndual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information\n(synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources\n(network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole\nreinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture\ncan successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The\nnetwork's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis\nwas sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while\ncontinual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after\nachieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes\npost-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks\nmaintained an average 82% success rate.",

    "abstract": "Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies\non large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However,\nthis one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper\ncontextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their\nbehavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to\nlanguage (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent\ncapable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal\nrepresentations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We\nintroduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such\nbidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly\ntrained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from\nlanguage (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying\nsemantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a\nself-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data\nthrough an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby\nimproving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on\npick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY\nimproves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust\nlanguage-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

Each pause potentially causes KV cache\neviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the\nfollowing LLM request. Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem\nbecomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs. Previous\nworks either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV\ncache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of\na multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases\nper-request latency.\n  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for\nmulti-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with\nprogram-level scheduling. By predicting tool call durations in agentic\nworkflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a\ntime-to-live value based on total turn number. When combined with program-level\nfirst-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves\nmulti-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic\nworkflows. By modeling the variability of tool call and agent program\ncontinuity, Continuum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation on\nreal-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B models\nshows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times,\nand remains performant across different hardware setups and DRAM offloading\nschemes.

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is\nensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected\nautonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control\nframework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic\n(SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model\nthe dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and\ntemporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a\nrobust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal\ncontrol through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the\nsystem to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with\nobjectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring\nsafety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated\nusing a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating\ndifferent traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%\nreduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to\ntraditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs\nimproved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types.\nThese findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for\nreal-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.",

    "abstract": "Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an\nimportant prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in\nparticular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques\nfor strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,\nlimiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring\npurposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for\nSLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning\n(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL\napproaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense\nframe-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point\ntrajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.\n  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly\naccessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to\ngenerate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with\nground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our\nevaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a\nmean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.\n  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation\nwith our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean\ndifference (95\\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).\nIncorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of\nthe models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that\nintegrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the\nprecision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United\nStates, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for\napproximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays\na vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits\nsuch as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional\nplant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often\ndestructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful\nframeworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of\nmulti-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable\nnon-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their\npromise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct\nthe entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,\nincreases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction\nframework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment\nAnything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean\nstrawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate\ngeometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With\na background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate\nimportant plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN\nclustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show\nthat our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and\nefficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry\nplant phenotyping.",

To validate BoolSkeleton's effectiveness,\nwe conducted four analysis/downstream tasks around the Boolean network:\ncompression analysis, classification, critical path analysis, and timing\nprediction, demonstrating its robustness across diverse scenarios. Furthermore,\nit improves above 55% in the average accuracy compared to the original Boolean\nnetwork for the timing prediction task.

To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,\na novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious\nsubstructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting\ndrug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively\nmitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious\nsubstructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In\naddition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where\ninterventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a\nnovel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and\nindependence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nbaseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.\nBesides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug\nsynergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the\nmolecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a\npractical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.",

In\norder to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,\nestimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse\nin-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,\nencouraging matched points to have close embeddings.

These limitations hinder fair\ncomparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in\nsecurity-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking\nframework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and\nreproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,\nfrozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and\ndiffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate\nperformance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,\nROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model\ninterpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations\ndemonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods\nexhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model\ntransferability.

    "abstract": "We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios\nwhere generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful\nreasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in\nMIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as\nsketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning\nprocess. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through\n\"drawing to think\". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically\nchallenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning\nsteps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our\nevaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,\nannotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a\nunified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation\ninput: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with\nimage and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image\nclues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity\non our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under\ndifferent k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large\nlanguage models, including strongest private models as well as strong\nopen-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.\nHowever, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves\nconsistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and\ntasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and\ndesigning textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited\nimprovements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the\ncritical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning\non MIRA.",

Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks\nsuch as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding\nunderexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG\ncode as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,\nfrontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap\nbetween language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we\nintroduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)\nThinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines\nSVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply\nstructured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic\ncapacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities\nscore well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D\nreasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing\nClaude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on\nrendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual\nrepresentation.

While significant\nprogress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of\nvideo data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct\nthe first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing\nthe capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal\nseveral key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly\ndepends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)\nand text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,\nespecially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric\ntest-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable\npredictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the\ncorrelation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and\nnon-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment\nagainst text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and\nunderstanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal\nalignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.\nOverall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot\nway to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal\ndata.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision\nsystems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to\nexplain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works\nsuggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be\nattributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance\npropagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find\nimages that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are\nlargely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered\nconcepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting\nthe accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.\n  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept\nRelevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a\nmultimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive\nnames to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that\ntranslate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To\nensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the\nsemantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and\nexplanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,\noffering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries\nfor non-technical stakeholders.\n  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a\nVGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution\nmethods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to\ninterpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant\nattention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language\nmodels (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion\nanalysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.\nEmotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it\ndifficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable\nrationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided\nreasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression\nanalysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the\ncore of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),\nspecifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These\nmodels undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning\nfor injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement\nlearning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data\ninfrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)\nconsisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes\nexplainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated\nrationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding\ntasks.

The intermediate feature representations are usually create by\ngenerating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing\nintermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do\nnot make good use of the intermediate features.

    "abstract": "Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for\nexample, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme\nviewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address\nthese challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that\nintroduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,\nwe include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and\nview biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale\nstabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to\nreinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for\nmotion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment\n(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical\nTemporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;\nand (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces\ncross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite\nadding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,\nMTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude\nlevels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS\ndatasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can\nsubstantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without\ncompromising computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by\nAIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from\nIndia. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from\n2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently\nannotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from\nacross India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14\nvehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler\n(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,\nHatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k\nconsensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct\nobjects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,\nwe train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,\nand DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,\nmAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in\nmAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with\nRT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40\nfor COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This\ndemonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic\nscenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus\nannotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the\n6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the\nheterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera\nstreams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and\noffers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of\nintelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic\nconditions.",

To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this\nstudy explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in\nshearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected\nautoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature\nmatching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled\ndataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect\npatterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under\nboth ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were\ndefined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one\nadditionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter\nsimulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced\nfringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated\nin terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial\ndefect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves\nsuperior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared\nto the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of\nfeature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,\na YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to\nbenchmark localization quality.

Traditionally, this process has been\nmanually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video\nediting technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often\nfail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly. To\naddress this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for\nvideo shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching\nbetween the script generated by a large language model and a video library to\nobtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we\nsegment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such\nas shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models\nto learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their\nalignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization\nby combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the\nassembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the\narrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,\nnarrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style\nof reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual\nexpression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience\ncan create visually compelling videos. Project page:\nhttps://sobeymil.github.io/esa.com",

    "abstract": "The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where\nfoundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\nshow great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for\nspecialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation\nstrategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new\nmulti-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this\nbenchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies\non a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter\nrecommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that\nthe optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT\nand ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by\ncontext-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of\n0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the\nsuperior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a\npowerful \"super-expert\" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm\nthe superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual\ninterference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked\nagainst strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer\nkey observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our\nbenchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for\ndeveloping more effective science-based agentic systems.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial\nfor measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,\nsatellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents\na cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object\ndetection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,\nheterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual\nlocalization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are\nextracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is\nestimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because\npublicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches\nrecast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these\ndatasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain\ndifferences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,\nor generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,\ncontent loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object\ndetection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite\nimages, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and\nintra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based\nnode-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization\nperformance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that\nour approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and\ngeneralizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,\nsuch as infrared-visible image matching.

    "abstract": "We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of\n765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set\nof precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in\nobject-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have\nshown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic\ndatasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,\nwhich limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse\noffers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real\nobjects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.\nSpecifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,\nspanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35\nDSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the\nsimulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we\nprovide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric\nsurface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct\nan extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world\nobject-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We\nbelieve that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next\ngeneration of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.\nThe full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly\nreleased at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.",

    "abstract": "Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple\ncamera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this\ntask, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by\ncombining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising\ncooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods\nfocus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire\nvideo, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action\nrecognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized\nsequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action\nrecognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we\nintroduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast\nto previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial\ninformation, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in\nthe STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our\nmodule, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model\nthe relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments\nusing a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the\ncomparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.",

    "abstract": "Mobile eye tracking plays a vital role in capturing human visual attention\nacross both real-world and extended reality (XR) environments, making it an\nessential tool for applications ranging from behavioural research to\nhuman-computer interaction. However, missing values due to blinks, pupil\ndetection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for\nfurther gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a\nmulti-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the\nfirst time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the\ninherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a\ntransformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye\nand head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional\nbody movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D,\nand HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms\nconventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series\nimputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses\nconfirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match\nactual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations.\nMoreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable\ndevices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture\nin the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our\nmethod paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in\nreal-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based\nanalysis and interaction across various application domains.",

Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for\na number of different initial parameter sets providing the system\ninput-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior\ndistributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions\nusing the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the\nleast Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most\nplausible results.

In the past, most\nprevious color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.\nThe purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color\ncorrection algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating\nthe overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and\nthen adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close\nproximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,\nnamely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated\noverlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target\npoints in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method\nis proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the\nhistogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a\nhistogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,\nwe discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our\nalgorithm.

    "abstract": "Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous\nmobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness\nof subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of\ncamera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often\nintroduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal\nsequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this\nproblem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler\nvelocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.\nHowever, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation\nfor use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and\ncost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of\nself-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point\nclouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised\nrepresentation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited\namounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss\nfunction with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain\nthe network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our\nmethod improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting\nstate-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.",

However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images\nwithin papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training\nmachine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the\nRxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).\nOur framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing\nprocess into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed \"BBox and Index as\nVisual Prompt\" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,\nMolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the\ninput image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language\ndescription problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy\nsignificantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model\ndesign. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude\nlarger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset\nacross four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.

    "abstract": "In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and\nbeyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world\nin multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain\nconstrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic\ntokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual\nperception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous\nVision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that\nleverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.\nThe core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent\nQ-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a\nchain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this\nprocess, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual\nregions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain\ngrounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines\ncontrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment\nbetween latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.\nEvaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong\nbaselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B\nmodels on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that\nlearned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,\nhighlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between\ndiscrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.",

Existing post-hoc\nOOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and\nlogits information without retraining.

To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware\nFeature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to\nrefine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it\nperforms global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This\ninvolves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights\nto decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical\ninformation: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution\n(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress\nfalse positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses\nthese decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for\ncomprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale\nbenchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong\ngeneralization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.",

However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy\ncamera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of\ndepth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain\nadaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the\nstyle of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated\nimages with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains\nbetween real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a\nlatent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by\nreducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central\nairway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on\nthe depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated\nsynthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent\ndomain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature\nconsistency.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its\nearly diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on\nmultimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising\nresults by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most\nexisting approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while\noverlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In\naddition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead\nto biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and\nConsistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The\nproposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to\ncompensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and\nmodality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific\nrepresentations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to\nexplicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental\nresults on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior\ndiagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.",

    "abstract": "Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between\nsensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and\nother limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a\nsubset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance\nunder such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer\nfrom reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces\nuncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether\nfoundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using\nreal-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models\noffer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central\ntechnique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,\nour study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing\nand shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction.

To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is\ndegraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy.

For system matrix\nrecovery on the Open MPI dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08\ndB, and SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling, and maintained strong performance even at\nchallenging scale 8x (pSNR = 31.06 dB, SSIM = 0.717). For the simulated\ndataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 4.44, pSNR = 28.52 dB, and SSIM = 0.771 at 2x\nscaling, with stable performance at higher scales. On average, it reduced nRMSE\nby 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, and improved SSIM by 34.3% over\ninterpolation and CNN-based methods.

This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for\nSLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning\n(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL\napproaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense\nframe-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point\ntrajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.\n  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly\naccessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to\ngenerate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with\nground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our\nevaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a\nmean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.\n  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation\nwith our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean\ndifference (95\\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).\nIncorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of\nthe models in quantifying abnormal deformation.

    "abstract": "Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United\nStates, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for\napproximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays\na vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits\nsuch as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional\nplant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often\ndestructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful\nframeworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of\nmulti-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable\nnon-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their\npromise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct\nthe entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,\nincreases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction\nframework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment\nAnything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean\nstrawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate\ngeometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With\na background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate\nimportant plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN\nclustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show\nthat our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and\nefficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry\nplant phenotyping.",

This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns\ncan be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We\ncollected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566\nparticipants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language\nmodel (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET\nimages.

Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in\nboth structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns\n(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show\nhigh agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80).

The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)\noutperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while\ncombining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).\nAblation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt\nengineering.

Understanding their chamber growth trajectory\nprovides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation\nunder changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from\nimaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying\nheavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and\nsubjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates\ninstance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in\nforaminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically\nreconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed\ntomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple\ninstance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of\nthe chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order\nreconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort\nwhile maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation\nmodels exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel\nfidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm\nremains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental\ntrajectories even under partial segmentation.

Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate\ntext, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning\nsupport. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates\nexisting foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible\nmultimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user\nintent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their\noutputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,\naudio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex\ncross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of\nspecialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while\nmaintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is\nmodular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models\nbecome available.",

We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to\nquantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.\nGRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without\naccess to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an\ninformation-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of\ngradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the\ndistilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%\nSpearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo\nstudents. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher\ncan improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the\nbest-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design\nchoices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when\ngenerating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size\nconstraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.\nAltogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively\nidentify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide\nfine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.",

While several carefully\ndesigned long-context evaluations have recently been released, these\nevaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,\nwhich allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This\nrepresents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We\nintroduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require\nanalyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating\nthese analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two\ntask sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can\neasily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a\ndownstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational\ndata. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to\nperform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over\ntemporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with\nGPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy\non both splits at 128K.

    "abstract": "Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM\ncontext, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,\nresulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the\ncurrent turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This\ntrade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,\nwe propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact\nmemory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses\nthe user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform\nsearch actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for\nsolving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn\ninteractions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize\nthis workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that\njointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of\nMemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of\ntrajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level\nadvantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as\nSearch-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines\non seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher\neven outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance\nbetween information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and\nlower computational overhead.

    "abstract": "Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action\nin the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks\nsuch as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding\nunderexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG\ncode as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,\nfrontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap\nbetween language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we\nintroduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)\nThinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines\nSVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply\nstructured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic\ncapacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities\nscore well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D\nreasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing\nClaude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on\nrendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual\nrepresentation.

    "abstract": "The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on\nagent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different\ninformation, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will\ncritically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,\neven under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical\nstudies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a\ncollaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative\ncapabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable\nautomated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving\necological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and\nclosed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our\nresults reveal a \"collaboration gap\": models that perform well solo often\ndegrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break\ndown dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well\nalone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting\nwith the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a \"relay inference\"\napproach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,\nclosing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware\nevaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative\ncapabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent\nskills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse\napplications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language\nmodels (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when\ntested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations.\nHowever, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific\nmanifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work\naddresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and\nconducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task\ntypes, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning\ntasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge\ntype consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased\nhallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a\nparticular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,\nis a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect\nother knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we\npropose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in\nthe later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced\nhallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge\nreduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing\nexcessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of\nhallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar\ncontexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar\nquestions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge\nlearning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved\nperformance.",

While recent high performance models and high quality datasets\nhave significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current\nmodels typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and\ncannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic\nchange detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization\nand limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We\nleverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop\nUniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange\nintegrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.\nOur model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction\nof three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange\nutilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,\neliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows\nUniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even\nwhen their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks\n(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,\nachieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,\nsurpassing all previous methods.

Our series of experiments significantly improves\nperformance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better\nto cold-start questions and users.

Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training\n(CPT) \"experts\" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable\nmulti-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\nmodel-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address\nthis gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and\nJapanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,\ncomplementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task\nArithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated\nfrom 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an\nexpert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while\nmerging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain\nskills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is\nhyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also\nsuggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent\nskills depend on more complex factors.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where\nadversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on\nsingle-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive\nmulti-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for\nautomated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate\non Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn\nbaselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern\nmanager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a\ntemperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on\nfailure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful\nrequests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial\nand open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent\nvulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks\nconsistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate\nthat alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to\nmaintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need\nfor multi-turn-aware defenses.",

    "abstract": "In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and\nbeyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world\nin multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain\nconstrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic\ntokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual\nperception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous\nVision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that\nleverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.\nThe core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent\nQ-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a\nchain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this\nprocess, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual\nregions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain\ngrounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines\ncontrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment\nbetween latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.\nEvaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong\nbaselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B\nmodels on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that\nlearned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,\nhighlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between\ndiscrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.",

Current studies have\nproposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation\nfor embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by\nleveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly\ntrained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,\nshowing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial\nembedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for\nsome queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal\nenvironments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal\nmultimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

Our extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models expose an\nalarming capability gap: even LLMs achieving impressive results on traditional\nbenchmarks demonstrate profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional\nmappings between language and spatial concept--a fundamental limitation that\nundermines their potential as genuine world models.

In order to\nunderstand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as\nexpected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries\nto probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple\nLLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples\nthe space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to\ncreate realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our\nevaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using\nLLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge\ntreatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies\non inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation\nLLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's\nKappa $\\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs\nyield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and\nraces. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as\nevaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but\nnon-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data.

    "abstract": "With the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs),\nefficient inference has become increasingly critical for practical deployment.\nDepth pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing the\ncomputational costs of large language models by removing transformer layers.\nHowever, existing methods typically rely on fixed block masks, which can lead\nto suboptimal performance across different tasks and inputs. In this paper, we\npropose IG-Pruning, a novel input-aware block-wise pruning method that\ndynamically selects layer masks at inference time. Our approach consists of two\nstages: (1) Discovering diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and\nL0 optimization, and (2) Implementing efficient dynamic pruning without the\nneed for extensive training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods, making\nit particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.",

Developing upon Utility Theory\nand leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric\nReasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.\nATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level\nsymbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it\nimplements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic\ntemplates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.\nValidated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA\nconsistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based\nmodels, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge\nmodels. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are\ncritical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall\npredictive performance.

We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to\nquantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.\nGRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without\naccess to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an\ninformation-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of\ngradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the\ndistilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%\nSpearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo\nstudents. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher\ncan improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the\nbest-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design\nchoices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when\ngenerating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size\nconstraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.\nAltogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively\nidentify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide\nfine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.",

As the\nfoundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to\nsupport new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the\nmodels towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we\nintroduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a\nnew evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;\ngeneralization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to\nsatellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also\ndevelop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its\ncross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation\nmodels for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose\nmodels like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to\nnew satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in\nperformance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,\nthe performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\\% when given\nadditional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the\nlast linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get\nrelatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the\nbenchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the\ndatasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing\nmodels with stronger cross-satellite generalization.",

    "abstract": "We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).\nWhile prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has\nreceived comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as\na non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four\nfamilies on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that\nsubtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the\nerrors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs\nfrequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing\nanalyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,\nyet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further\ntest well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to\nsee if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while\nfew-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve\nnear-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these\nfindings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and\nrecoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning\n(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without\ncentralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing\nsensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a\nclient's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can\nlaunch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client\nparticipated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a\nclient's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),\nthereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing\ninputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client\nexposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates\nmost relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat\nvectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)\nadversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted\ncentral server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes\nthat the server has access to a validation/test set with global data\ndistribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds\nshowed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with\n147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in\ngeneral the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be\nefficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10\ndataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy\nimprovement and 33% cumulative privacy.",

    "abstract": "Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical\nanalyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and\nlittle is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we\nshow that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by\nits adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.\nMore specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the\nmanifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness\nmeasure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a\ncontinuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We\nfurther demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a\nwell-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,\nSGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\\tr(\\mH)$,\nwhereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\\tr(\\Diag(\\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In\nsolving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this\ndistinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than\nSGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of\nadaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,\nand provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce\nsharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.",

Meeting the objectives depends on modeling\nchoices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional\ngenerative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input\nrepresentation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE\n(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),\na scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an\nautoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like\nmolecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The\nlatent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property\npredictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the\nlatent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:\n(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on\nSELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable\nformulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with\nlow-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation\nwith limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,\nour approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal\nsmooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional\nexploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the\nconditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted\nbinding.

    "abstract": "Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air\ncomputation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of\narbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which\nis restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of\ncomputational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication\nsystems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local\ninformation processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp\nis currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous\ndata-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is\nsusceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of\nthe ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with\nmultiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector\nfunction computation but also ensures scalability in the computational\ncomplexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,\nVecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel\nimpairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric\napplications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared\nerror of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel\nconditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in\nimproving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over\nnoisy and fading multiple-access channels.",

In contrast, solo\nexperiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,\ncollaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock\ntheir potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that\ntransfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a\nshared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation\nduring multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an\nMoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse\ncooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency\nand performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo\ndemonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data,\nmaking cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.",

Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,\nConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.\nThis concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more\nlikely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that\nConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO.

Given the high stakes of pedagogical\ndecisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense\nthat they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide\nexplicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study\nto date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually\nhelps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we\nperform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on\ninterpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a\nnon-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human\nteachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT\nmodels. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of\nusability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until\nmastery hardly differs between KT models.

We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a\nbinary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum\nstrategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes\nthe trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate\nthe effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large\nlanguage model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a\nmulti-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.\nThese results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the\nefficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory\nconstraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy\nenables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial\ninference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for\nresource-constrained deployment.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse\napplications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning capabilities\nthrough transformer architectures with attention mechanisms. However,\ntransformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention\nmodule (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which\nseverely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is\ncritical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under\nhigh request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.\n  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with\nlinear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent\ncomputation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we\nintroduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer\nattention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.\nThese models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained\nreasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing\nless critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.\n  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with\ndifferent SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as\nmore Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant\nof Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,\nachieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the\nproduction-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning\nperformance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can\ndeliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent\nwithout substantially compromising the reasoning quality.",

To address these, we propose Federated Attention\n(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention\nmechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and\ncomputational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local\nself-attention over their own token representations while periodically\nexchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer\nblocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private\nprompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual\nrepresentation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across\nprivate data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight\nprovides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated\noptimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this\nframework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within\nparticipants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error\npropagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the\nfundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation\nefficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of\nparticipants.

They are trained to act as identity operators on the data and as\nidempotent operators off the data manifold. However, IGNs suffer from mode\ncollapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to their objectives,\nwhich contain adversarial components and can cause the model to cover the data\nmanifold only partially -- an issue shared with generative adversarial\nnetworks. We introduce Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs)\nto address these issues.

    "abstract": "The development of smart systems (i.e., systems enhanced with AI components)\nhas thrived thanks to the rapid advancements in neural networks (NNs). A wide\nrange of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN\ndesign and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available\nfunctionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After\nadopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to\nanother if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are\nintroduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is\nchallenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for\nNNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual\nupdates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure\ncompatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to\nautomatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our\nmethod makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior\nto migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely\nPyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code\nbetween the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.\nExperimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully\nmigrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the\noriginals.

    "abstract": "Associative memory, traditionally modeled by Hopfield networks, enables the\nretrieval of previously stored patterns from partial or noisy cues. Yet, the\nlocal computational principles which are required to enable this function\nremain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information\nprocessing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory\n- Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of\ndifferent inputs to an output into unique information from each input,\nredundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges\nfrom combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons\nin classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the\ninformation in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between\nthe external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and\nunique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and\nperformance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as\nan information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each\nneuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more\nthan tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks\nand even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield\nnetworks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new\ndesign principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new\nassociative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.",

This ensures\nsemantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite\nlayers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring\nfine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our\ntraining-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,\nenhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and\nfidelity.

    "abstract": "Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most\nsuccessful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and\neffectiveness across a range of problems.\n  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and\nbehavior policies to move to the \"right\" direction -- starting from importance\nsampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive\nadvantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function\nis introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio\nin these \"right\" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to\nextend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering\nthe clipping in the \"right\" direction regions. However, due to randomness in\nthe rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the\nratios frequently move to the \"wrong\" direction during the PPO optimization.\nThis is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely\noverlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm\n(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict \"wrong\"\ndirection regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance\nratio falls below (above) $1 - \\beta$ ($1+\\beta$),\n  for a tunable parameter $\\beta \\in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a\nsteeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that\nDClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing\non modifying the objective's behavior in the \"right\" direction, across various\nMuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is\nshown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid \"wrong\" direction\nupdates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.",

We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows\nprotection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors,\nleveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected\nor overcome.

For sparse\nErd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales\nas $p_e = \\Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at\nrate $O(\\frac{\\log d}{\\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the\nexpected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This\nconcentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in\nlarge-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\\'asi--Albert\ngraphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies\n$\\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\\beta - \\frac{1}{2}})$ with\n$\\beta = 1/(\\gamma - 1) < \\frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit.

    "abstract": "Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed\nacross institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of\ndiscriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in\npart, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.\nCausal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,\ndiscrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of\nbiomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms\nrather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological\nfoundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal\nrepresentation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and\ncounterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating\nclinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,\ncancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological\nmonitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting\nprescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific\nCausal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with\nintegration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph\nneural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,\nincluding computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,\nvalidation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond\ncross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal\nterminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks\ndistinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated\ndiscoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than\npurely associational claims.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to many-vs-many missile guidance using\nvirtual targets (VTs) generated by a Normalizing Flows-based trajectory\npredictor. Rather than assigning n interceptors directly to m physical targets\nthrough conventional weapon target assignment algorithms, we propose a\ncentralized strategy that constructs n VT trajectories representing\nprobabilistic predictions of maneuvering target behavior. Each interceptor is\nguided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse\nflight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal\ninterception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as\nmany-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n > m) by\ndistributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than\npursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across\nvarious target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors)\ndemonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line\nprediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to\n5.8-14.4% when n > m. The results confirm that probabilistic VTs enable\neffective exploitation of numerical superiority, significantly increasing\ninterception probability in many-vs-many scenarios.",

In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate\nrelationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve.\nWith the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been\nextensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants,\nwhile the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper,\nwe propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP\n(OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning\napproach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we\nreformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various\ndecisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based\nmethods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing\ndecisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism\ndesigned to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental\nresults on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution\nquality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over\nrepresentative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and\nOCLRP.",

To operationalize\nthis theory, we introduce the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck\n(V-GIB), a variational estimator that unifies mutual-information compression\nand curvature regularization through tractable geometric proxies such as the\nHutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, and local PCA.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for\nrepresentation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as\nTransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent\nlimitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.\nIn this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model\nthat challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a\ncompact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear\nSpherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as\na hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments\non three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate\nthat SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean\ncounterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237\nand CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We\nprovide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing\nthat this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to\ncomprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,\nwe prove that the spherical geometry creates an \"inherently hard negative\nsampling\" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the\nmodel to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our\nfindings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an\nimplementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for\ngeometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful\nand stable KGE models.",

To trade-off between\nexploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory\nby minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence\nBound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected\nlocational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward\nregions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared\nto previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion,\nrelying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents.\nIn particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy\nselection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.",

While the segmentation of\ncamera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often\nintroduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal\nsequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this\nproblem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler\nvelocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.\nHowever, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation\nfor use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and\ncost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of\nself-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point\nclouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised\nrepresentation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited\namounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss\nfunction with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain\nthe network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our\nmethod improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting\nstate-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.",

While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical\nstandard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently\nsubjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to\nautomate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and\nefficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network\narchitectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal\npatterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current\nmodels often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially\nwhen dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in\nbiomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM\narchitecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound\nrecordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the\nH-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.\nExtensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a\npublic benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed\nmodel achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a\ntest accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.",

Current studies have\nproposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation\nfor embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by\nleveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly\ntrained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,\nshowing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial\nembedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for\nsome queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal\nenvironments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal\nmultimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

Inspired by continuous learning and\nmodular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that\nautonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve\nmore efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we\ndesign a closed-loop \"attack-evaluate-distill-reuse\" core mechanism that not\nonly generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes\nreusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate\nand apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library\nthat categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on\ntheir performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise\nguidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and\ntransferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting,\nand the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR)\nof 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.",

However, existing GNNs exhibit poor\ngeneralization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in\ndynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent\nnon-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving\nGraph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware\ninvariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment\nsequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer\nthe underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for\nenvironment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address\nenvironmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we\nconduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture\nof instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish\nspatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in\nnon-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority\nof EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution\nshifts.

    "abstract": "Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling\nefficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target\ndistributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often\nsufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has\nexplored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as\ncomponents of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical\nstudies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling\nefficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt\ntheir architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC\nsimilarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or\nsuperior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose\na factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by\ncombining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to\ntarget geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are\napproximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional\nNF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail\nsamples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better\nperformance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood\nand prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on\nhierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel\ngeometries.

    "abstract": "Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful\nframework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains.\nRecently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP\nsolvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches\nare developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability\nto generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major\nobstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts\nframework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes\nproblem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The\nmodel is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization\nstrategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and\nintra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task\nembeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's\ngeneralization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance\nwithin each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general\nintrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on\nthree domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five\ndiverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot\nsetting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on\nchallenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often\nstruggle to generalize.",

Intensity-modulated\ncarbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but\nremains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading\nto laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many\ntreatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are\nlimited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)\nstruggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We\npropose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45\nTPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)\nQMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for\nstable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance\nefficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)\napply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to\nuniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed\npiecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker\nsystem interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and\naccelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10\ntesting), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans\ncomparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL\n$85.93\\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05)\nimprovements for five OARs.

Under this formulation, learning the surrogate\ntransition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which\ncan be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the\nmodel is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage\nusing ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics.

In this work, we investigate the effects of\nutilizing information on the spectral bias in the initialization of neural\nnetworks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the\nSWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden\nlayers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden\nlayers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the\nMNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the\nconventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of\nintrinsic spectral properties in learning neural networks, and the finding\nyields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their\ntraining performance.",

    "abstract": "Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible\nlearning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the\nStructurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel\ncomputational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the\nmorphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates\non a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local\nprediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning\nmechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the\ntemporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned\nexpectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically\nmigrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This\ndual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information\n(synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources\n(network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole\nreinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture\ncan successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The\nnetwork's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis\nwas sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while\ncontinual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after\nachieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes\npost-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks\nmaintained an average 82% success rate.",

The experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%\nreduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to\ntraditional methods.

Our approach builds on recent advances in\nadaptive step-size techniques for no-regret algorithms in normal-form games,\nand extends them to the Markovian setting via a stage-wise scheme that adjusts\nlearning rates based on real-time feedback. We frame policy updates as an\ninstance of Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL), customized for\nvalue-iteration-based learning. The resulting self-play algorithm achieves, to\nour knowledge, the fastest known convergence rate to CCE in Markov games.",

The demand for algorithms that not only\nexhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such\nfields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper,\nwe present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of\nmultivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the\nProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique\nchallenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and\nhandling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified\nconvolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an\nautoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We\nevaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA\narchive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as\nnon-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation\nstudies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among\nante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with\nnon-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable\nresults accessible to domain experts.",

Current studies have\nproposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation\nfor embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by\nleveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly\ntrained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,\nshowing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial\nembedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for\nsome queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal\nenvironments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal\nmultimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

By integrating symbolic\nknowledge with user-item interactions, KGs enrich semantic representations,\nsupport reasoning, and enhance model interpretability. Despite this potential,\nexisting KG-based methods still face major challenges in CDR, particularly\nunder non-overlapping user scenarios. These challenges arise from: (C1)\nsensitivity to KG sparsity and popularity bias, (C2) dependence on overlapping\nusers for domain alignment and (C3) lack of explicit disentanglement between\ntransferable and domain-specific knowledge, which limit effective and stable\nknowledge transfer. To this end, we propose KGBridge, a knowledge-guided prompt\nlearning framework for cross-domain sequential recommendation under\nnon-overlapping user scenarios. KGBridge comprises two core components: a\nKG-enhanced Prompt Encoder, which models relation-level semantics as soft\nprompts to provide structured and dynamic priors for user sequence modeling\n(addressing C1), and a Two-stage Training Paradigm, which combines cross-domain\npretraining and privacy-preserving fine-tuning to enable knowledge transfer\nwithout user overlap (addressing C2). By combining relation-aware semantic\ncontrol with correspondence-driven disentanglement, KGBridge explicitly\nseparates and balances domain-shared and domain-specific semantics, thereby\nmaintaining complementarity and stabilizing adaptation during fine-tuning\n(addressing C3). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nKGBridge consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and remains robust\nunder varying KG sparsity, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating\nstructural imbalance and semantic entanglement in KG-enhanced cross-domain\nrecommendation.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in large-scale robotic datasets and vision-language models\n(VLMs) has advanced research on vision-language-action (VLA) models. However,\nexisting VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing\nprecise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging\ndomain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot\nembodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent\nvariables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy\nlearning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal\nknowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we\npresent X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable\nVLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces\nthe \\emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation\nlearned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and\nrobotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an\nintermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii)\naligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to\ncapture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a\nthree-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii)\nUVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and\n(iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive\nreal-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot\nembodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\\pi_{0.5}$, $\\pi_0$, RDT,\nUniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel\nobjects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to many-vs-many missile guidance using\nvirtual targets (VTs) generated by a Normalizing Flows-based trajectory\npredictor. Rather than assigning n interceptors directly to m physical targets\nthrough conventional weapon target assignment algorithms, we propose a\ncentralized strategy that constructs n VT trajectories representing\nprobabilistic predictions of maneuvering target behavior. Each interceptor is\nguided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse\nflight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal\ninterception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as\nmany-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n > m) by\ndistributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than\npursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across\nvarious target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors)\ndemonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line\nprediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to\n5.8-14.4% when n > m. The results confirm that probabilistic VTs enable\neffective exploitation of numerical superiority, significantly increasing\ninterception probability in many-vs-many scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies\non large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However,\nthis one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper\ncontextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their\nbehavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to\nlanguage (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent\ncapable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal\nrepresentations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We\nintroduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such\nbidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly\ntrained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from\nlanguage (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying\nsemantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a\nself-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data\nthrough an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby\nimproving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on\npick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY\nimproves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust\nlanguage-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a quantitative comparison between centralised and\ndistributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) architectures for\ncontrolling a soft robotic arm modelled as a Cosserat rod in simulation. Using\nPyElastica and the OpenAI Gym interface, we train both a global Proximal Policy\nOptimisation (PPO) controller and a Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) under identical\nbudgets. Both approaches are based on the arm having $n$ number of controlled\nsections. The study systematically varies $n$ and evaluates the performance of\nthe arm to reach a fixed target in three scenarios: default baseline condition,\nrecovery from external disturbance, and adaptation to actuator failure.\nQuantitative metrics used for the evaluation are mean action magnitude, mean\nfinal distance, mean episode length, and success rate. The results show that\nthere are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of\ncontrolled sections $n\\le4$. In very simple systems, when $n\\le2$, the\ncentralised policy outperforms the distributed one. When $n$ increases to $4<\nn\\le 12$, the distributed policy shows a high sample efficiency. In these\nsystems, distributed policy promotes a stronger success rate, resilience, and\nrobustness under local observability and yields faster convergence given the\nsame sample size. However, centralised policies achieve much higher time\nefficiency during training as it takes much less time to train the same size of\nsamples. These findings highlight the trade-offs between centralised and\ndistributed policy in reinforcement learning-based control for soft robotic\nsystems and provide actionable design guidance for future sim-to-real transfer\nin soft rod-like manipulators.",

    "abstract": "Collaborating teams of robots show promise due in their ability to complete\nmissions more efficiently and with improved robustness, attributes that are\nparticularly useful for systems operating in marine environments. A key issue\nis how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the\nfull benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of\nmulti-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This\npaper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the\nprinciple of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for\ncollective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior\noptimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component\nis expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective\nbehavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model\ncan be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization\nand control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors\nthat are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new\nmethod for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where\nrobots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost\nfunctions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states\nfrom neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group\ncan collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the\ntotal global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in\nthree categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface\nvehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario,\nand a competitive game of capture the flag.",

To address this issue, we adopt a robust\nloss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of\nthe residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust\nformulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains\nstable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss\nreshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted\nisometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.\nThrough theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels\nat handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.\nThis work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine\nlearning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and\nbroadly applicable analytical framework.",

This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance\npurchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs\nis evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they\nfall short in estimating quantitative probabilities.

The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to\nextrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is\nintractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation\nof temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life\ntrajectory.

This distinction is critical for AI\nalignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human\nintentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in\npreference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,\npresenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,\ninformal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a\nmodel's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of\ngeneralizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.\nAcross 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize\ndeep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than\nsmaller models.

The versatile\nnature of LLMs makes them applicable to a wide range of such tasks. While the\nperformance of recent LLMs is generally outstanding, several studies have shown\nthat they can often produce incorrect results. Automatically identifying these\nfaulty behaviors is extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of LLMs.\nOne obstacle to this is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which\nnecessitates an oracle to determine the correctness of LLM behaviors.\nMetamorphic testing (MT) is a popular testing approach that alleviates this\noracle problem. At the core of MT are metamorphic relations (MRs), which define\nrelationships between the outputs of related inputs. MT can expose faulty\nbehaviors without the need for explicit oracles (e.g., labeled datasets). This\npaper presents the most comprehensive study of MT for LLMs to date. We\nconducted a literature review and collected 191 MRs for NLP tasks. We\nimplemented a representative subset (36 MRs) to conduct a series of experiments\nwith three popular LLMs, running approximately 560,000 metamorphic tests.

Fusion data shows non-stationary\nbehavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and\nmachine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to\nmaintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.\nOnline learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has\nbeen largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an\napplication of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream\nfor prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion\nfacility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain\nML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.\nMoreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance\ndegradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As\nsuch, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further\nimprove the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)\ntechnique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the\nuncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces\npredictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of\nhistorical data.

    "abstract": "Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,\nmarkerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted\ndisplay, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in\nreal-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd\nTracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)\ndepth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)\nglobal and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by\ncomparing \"skin-to-bone\" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot\nmodels, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target\ntrials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap\nharvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per\ntrial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced\nand CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,\n1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by\nanatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm\ncoverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed\nsignificantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,\nmarkerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,\nand lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical\nclinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization\nplus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or\nlow-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR\nguidance.",

Despite their potential, it\nremains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A\nsystematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still\nlacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To\naddress this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a\nPrithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using\nPlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance\namong all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models\nacross sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and\nSentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In\nleave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly\nbetter performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),\n0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA\n(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and\nSentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out\ncross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual\ninspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot\nexperiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training\nimages, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational\ntime, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),\nmaking it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).\nContrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate\nimprovements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling\neffort compared to traditional U-Net.",

    "abstract": "Although transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\nvarious domains, their quadratic attention mechanisms introduce significant\ncomputational overhead when processing long-sequence data. In this paper, we\npresent a unified autonomous driving model, UniLION, which efficiently handles\nlarge-scale LiDAR point clouds, high-resolution multi-view images, and even\ntemporal sequences based on the linear group RNN operator (i.e., performs\nlinear RNN for grouped features). Remarkably, UniLION serves as a single\nversatile architecture that can seamlessly support multiple specialized\nvariants (i.e., LiDAR-only, temporal LiDAR, multi-modal, and multi-modal\ntemporal fusion configurations) without requiring explicit temporal or\nmulti-modal fusion modules. Moreover, UniLION consistently delivers competitive\nand even state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of core tasks,\nincluding 3D perception (e.g., 3D object detection, 3D object tracking, 3D\noccupancy prediction, BEV map segmentation), prediction (e.g., motion\nprediction), and planning (e.g., end-to-end planning). This unified paradigm\nnaturally simplifies the design of multi-modal and multi-task autonomous\ndriving systems while maintaining superior performance. Ultimately, we hope\nUniLION offers a fresh perspective on the development of 3D foundation models\nin autonomous driving. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/happinesslz/UniLION",

In\ncontrast, certain works directly produce 3D information via fast network\ninferences, but their results are often of low quality and lack geometric\ndetails.

To\nensure the consistency of generation, we employ a multi-view cross-domain\nattention mechanism that facilitates information exchange across views and\nmodalities. Lastly, we introduce a cascaded 3D mesh extraction algorithm that\ndrives high-quality surfaces from the multi-view 2D representations in only\nabout $3$ minute in a coarse-to-fine manner.

    "abstract": "2D-to-3D human pose lifting is a fundamental challenge for 3D human pose\nestimation in monocular video, where graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and\nattention mechanisms have proven to be inherently suitable for encoding the\nspatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joints. However, depth ambiguity and\nerrors in 2D pose estimation lead to incoherence in the 3D trajectory. Previous\nstudies have attempted to restrict jitters in the time domain, for instance, by\nconstraining the differences between adjacent frames while neglecting the\nglobal spatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joint motion. To tackle this\nproblem, we design HGFreNet, a novel GraphFormer architecture with hop-hybrid\nfeature aggregation and 3D trajectory consistency in the frequency domain.\nSpecifically, we propose a hop-hybrid graph attention (HGA) module and a\nTransformer encoder to model global joint spatial-temporal correlations. The\nHGA module groups all $k$-hop neighbors of a skeletal joint into a hybrid group\nto enlarge the receptive field and applies the attention mechanism to discover\nthe latent correlations of these groups globally. We then exploit global\ntemporal correlations by constraining trajectory consistency in the frequency\ndomain. To provide 3D information for depth inference across frames and\nmaintain coherence over time, a preliminary network is applied to estimate the\n3D pose. Extensive experiments were conducted on two standard benchmark\ndatasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. The results demonstrate that the proposed\nHGFreNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of positional\naccuracy and temporal consistency.",

Most existing research centers on adversarial robustness (AR),\nwhich evaluates models under worst-case scenarios by examining the existence of\ndeterministic adversarial examples (AEs). In contrast, probabilistic robustness\n(PR) adopts a statistical perspective, measuring the probability that\npredictions remain correct under stochastic perturbations. While PR is widely\nregarded as a practical complement to AR, dedicated training methods for\nimproving PR are still relatively underexplored, albeit with emerging progress.\nAmong the few PR-targeted training methods, we identify three limitations: i\nnon-comparable evaluation protocols; ii limited comparisons to strong AT\nbaselines despite anecdotal PR gains from AT; and iii no unified framework to\ncompare the generalization of these methods. Thus, we introduce PRBench, the\nfirst benchmark dedicated to evaluating improvements in PR achieved by\ndifferent robustness training methods. PRBench empirically compares most common\nAT and PR-targeted training methods using a comprehensive set of metrics,\nincluding clean accuracy, PR and AR performance, training efficiency, and\ngeneralization error (GE). We also provide theoretical analysis on the GE of PR\nperformance across different training methods. Main findings revealed by\nPRBench include: AT methods are more versatile than PR-targeted training\nmethods in terms of improving both AR and PR performance across diverse\nhyperparameter settings, while PR-targeted training methods consistently yield\nlower GE and higher clean accuracy.

Recent work integrates future images into the\nunderstanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand,\ngenerate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and\nactions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality\nunification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate\nprocesses, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our\ncore philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a\nsynchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions\nto evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance.\nWe ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint\nDiscrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process\nthat integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve\nas the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be\nintrinsically synergistic.

Despite its diagnostic value, IHC remains a costly and\nlabor-intensive technique. Its limited scalability and constraints in\nmultiplexing further hinder widespread adoption, especially in resource-limited\nsettings. Consequently, researchers are increasingly exploring computational\nstain translation techniques to synthesize IHC-equivalent images from\nH&E-stained slides, aiming to extract protein-level information more\nefficiently and cost-effectively. However, most existing stain translation\ntechniques rely on a linearly weighted summation of multiple loss terms within\na single objective function, strategy that often overlooks the interdepedence\namong these components-resulting in suboptimal image quality and an inability\nto simultaneously preserve structural authenticity and color fidelity. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a novel network architecture that follows a\nprogressive structure, incorporating color and cell border generation logic,\nwhich enables each visual aspect to be optimized in a stage-wise and decoupled\nmanner. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed network architecture, we\nbuild upon the Adaptive Supervised PatchNCE (ASP) framework as our baseline. We\nintroduce additional loss functions based on 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB)\nchromogen concentration and image gradient, enhancing color fidelity and cell\nboundary clarity in the generated IHC images.

However, as they are typically optimized in\nsemantic latent space, where proximity does not guarantee physical correctness\nin visual space, they often produce unrealistic results, such as overexposed\nhighlights, misaligned shadows, and incorrect occlusions. We address this with\nUniLumos, a unified relighting framework for both images and videos that brings\nRGB-space geometry feedback into a flow matching backbone. By supervising the\nmodel with depth and normal maps extracted from its outputs, we explicitly\nalign lighting effects with the scene structure, enhancing physical\nplausibility. Nevertheless, this feedback requires high-quality outputs for\nsupervision in visual space, making standard multi-step denoising\ncomputationally expensive. To mitigate this, we employ path consistency\nlearning, allowing supervision to remain effective even under few-step training\nregimes. To enable fine-grained relighting control and supervision, we design a\nstructured six-dimensional annotation protocol capturing core illumination\nattributes. Building upon this, we propose LumosBench, a disentangled\nattribute-level benchmark that evaluates lighting controllability via large\nvision-language models, enabling automatic and interpretable assessment of\nrelighting precision across individual dimensions.

However, directly applying existing\nRL methods to diffusion-based image restoration models is suboptimal, as the\nobjective of restoration fundamentally differs from that of pure generation: it\nplaces greater emphasis on fidelity. In this paper, we investigate how to\neffectively integrate RL into diffusion-based restoration models. First,\nthrough extensive experiments with various reward functions, we find that an\neffective reward can be derived from an Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model,\ninstead of intuitive ground-truth-based supervision, which has already been\noptimized during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Moreover,\nour strategy focuses on using RL for challenging samples that are significantly\ndistant from the ground truth, and our RL approach is innovatively implemented\nusing MLLM-based IQA models to align distributions with high-quality images\ninitially. As the samples approach the ground truth's distribution, RL is\nadaptively combined with SFT for more fine-grained alignment. This dynamic\nprocess is facilitated through an automatic weighting strategy that adjusts\nbased on the relative difficulty of the training samples. Our strategy is\nplug-and-play that can be seamlessly applied to diffusion-based restoration\nmodels, boosting its performance across various restoration tasks. Extensive\nexperiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed RL framework.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have\nsignificantly improved 2D visual understanding, prompting interest in their\napplication to complex 3D reasoning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether\nthese models can effectively capture the detailed spatial information required\nfor robust real-world performance, especially cross-view consistency, a key\nrequirement for accurate 3D reasoning. Considering this issue, we introduce\nViewpoint Learning, a task designed to evaluate and improve the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We present the Viewpoint-100K dataset,\nconsisting of 100K object-centric image pairs with diverse viewpoints and\ncorresponding question-answer pairs. Our approach employs a two-stage\nfine-tuning strategy: first, foundational knowledge is injected to the baseline\nMLLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on Viewpoint-100K, resulting in\nsignificant improvements across multiple tasks; second, generalization is\nenhanced through Reinforcement Learning using the Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) algorithm on a broader set of questions. Additionally, we\nintroduce a hybrid cold-start initialization method designed to simultaneously\nlearn viewpoint representations and maintain coherent reasoning thinking.\nExperimental results show that our approach significantly activates the spatial\nreasoning ability of MLLM, improving performance on both in-domain and\nout-of-domain reasoning tasks.

    "abstract": "In the retrieval domain, candidates' fusion from heterogeneous retrievers is\na long-standing challenge, particularly for complex, multi-modal data such as\nvideos. While typical fusion techniques are training-free, they rely solely on\nrank or score signals, disregarding candidates' representations. This work\nintroduces Vote-in-Context (ViC), a generalized, training-free framework that\nre-thinks list-wise reranking and fusion as a zero-shot reasoning task for a\nVision-Language Model (VLM). The core insight is to serialize both content\nevidence and retriever metadata directly within the VLM's prompt, allowing the\nmodel to adaptively weigh retriever consensus against visual-linguistic\ncontent. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by applying it to the\nchallenging domain of cross-modal video retrieval. To this end, we introduce\nthe S-Grid, a compact serialization map that represents each video as an image\ngrid, optionally paired with subtitles to enable list-wise reasoning over video\ncandidates. ViC is evaluated both as a single-list reranker, where it\ndramatically improves the precision of individual retrievers, and as an\nensemble fuser, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines like\nCombSUM. Across video retrieval benchmarks including ActivityNet and VATEX, the\nframework establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval performance,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex visual and temporal signals\nalongside text. In zero-shot settings, ViC achieves Recall@1 scores of 87.1%\n(t2v) / 89.0% (v2t) on MSR-VTT and 99.6% (v2t) on VATEX, representing massive\ngains of up to +40 Recall@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines. We\npresent ViC as a simple, reproducible, and highly effective recipe for turning\nmodern VLMs into powerful zero-shot rerankers and fusers.

We introduce two key steps\ntoward clinically and benchmark-ready anatomical shape classification via\nself-supervised graph autoencoding. We propose Precomputed Structural Pooling\n(PSPooling), a non-learnable mesh pooling operator designed for efficient and\nstructure-preserving graph coarsening in 3D anatomical shape analysis.\nPSPooling precomputes node correspondence sets based on geometric proximity,\nenabling parallelizable and reversible pooling and unpooling operations with\nguaranteed support structure. This design avoids the sparsity and\nreconstruction issues of selection-based methods and the sequential overhead of\nedge contraction approaches, making it particularly suitable for\nhigh-resolution medical meshes. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we integrate\nPSPooling into a self-supervised graph autoencoder that learns anatomy-aware\nrepresentations from unlabeled surface meshes. We evaluate the downstream\nbenefits on MedShapeNet19, a new curated benchmark dataset we derive from\nMedShapeNet, consisting of 19 anatomical classes with standardized training,\nvalidation, and test splits.

Continuous\ntokenizer (CT) achieves strong performance by bridging multiple\nindependently-trained understanding modules and generation modules, but suffers\nfrom complex multi-stage pipelines and substantial engineering overhead.\nConversely, discrete tokenizers (DT) offer a conceptually elegant idea by\nquantizing each image into a primitive, but inevitably leading to information\nloss and performance degradation. To resolve this tension, we question the\nbinary choice between CT and DT, inspired by the wave-particle duality of\nlight, and propose the Continuous-Discrete Dualistic Visual Tokenizer (CDD-VT).\nWe treat visual data as a flexible composition of image primitives derived from\nquantized codebooks, with the crucial insight that the primitive number\nassigned to each visual sample is adaptively determined according to its\ncomplexity: simple instances use a few primitives, emulating discrete\ntokenization, while complex instances use many, approximating continuous\ntokenization. Two core components are designed: Diverse Quantitative\nPrimitives, which encourage primitives orthogonality to better populate\ninformation space, and Dynamic Primitive Allocator, which assesses sample\ncomplexity to determine the optimal set of primitives.

In this paper, we tailor one Parallel Decoupling Framework (PDF)\nfor multimodal embedding learning, by utilizing the proprietary steerability of\nMLLMs, i.e., their ability to flexibly generate quite differentiated response\nunder explicit instructions. Concretely, PDF conditions a shared MLLM backbone\non distinct, learnable prefixes to roll out multiple parallel paths for one\ninput, then relies on these paths to obtain parallel embeddings. To promote\nfull parallel diversity, we employ Mutual Information Minimization (MIM) as an\nexplicit constraint, coupled with per-path contrastive supervision to maintain\nsemantic alignment. Such dual-objectives force PDF to yield robust semantic\ncoverage and a generalizable embedding space. Ultimately, the remarkable\nembedding space are accessible at inference via one single forward pass,\nincurring negligible computational overhead. We instantiate PDF on multiple\nMLLM backbones and prove its effectiveness on MMEB benchmark.

    "abstract": "Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate\ndisaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations\nin the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to\nunderstand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence\nacross wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human\ndecision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance\npurchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs\nis evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they\nfall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this\nlimitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules\nincluding perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.\nThe retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground\ndecisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal\nand bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to\nextrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is\nintractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation\nof temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life\ntrajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral\nmodeling and policy analysis.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that\ndirectly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human\nvalues or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI\nalignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human\nintentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in\npreference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,\npresenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,\ninformal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a\nmodel's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of\ngeneralizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.\nAcross 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize\ndeep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than\nsmaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three\nseparate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of\na core feature of alignment.",

    "abstract": "The growth dynamics of complex systems often exhibit statistical regularities\ninvolving power-law relationships. For real finite complex systems formed by\ncountable tokens (animals, words) as instances of distinct types (species,\ndictionary entries), an inverse power-law scaling $S \\sim r^{-\\alpha}$ between\ntype count $S$ and type rank $r$, widely known as Zipf's law, is widely\nobserved to varying degrees of fidelity. A secondary, summary relationship is\nHeaps' law, which states that the number of types scales sublinearly with the\ntotal number of observed tokens present in a growing system. Here, we propose\nan idealized model of a growing system that (1) deterministically produces\narbitrary inverse power-law count rankings for types, and (2) allows us to\ndetermine the exact asymptotics of the type-token relationship. Our argument\nimproves upon and remedies earlier work. We obtain a unified asymptotic\nexpression for all values of $\\alpha$, which corrects the special cases of\n$\\alpha = 1$ and $\\alpha \\gg 1$. Our approach relies solely on the form of\ncount rankings, avoids unnecessary approximations, and does not involve any\nstochastic mechanisms or sampling processes. We thereby demonstrate that a\ngeneral type-token relationship arises solely as a consequence of Zipf's law.",

We evaluate conversational response quality along three\naxes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on\n5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune\na 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.\nAcross 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms\nlabel-only baselines.\n  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace\nhuman-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet\nvocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words\nvariants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve\naccuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true\nexplanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,\nindicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra\ntoken budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a\nregularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.\n  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit\nhigher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive\nmass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before\ndecision.

SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct initially performs around chance level on\nTextual MNIST, and is capable of learning the task through RIGSA, 4-bit QLoRA\nand random masking. In spite of having more trainable parameters than QLoRA,\nthe RIGSA configurations that we studied displayed less forgetting than QLoRA,\nparticularly on GSM8k, though it performs comparably to random masking.",

    "abstract": "Open-ended generation tasks require outputs to satisfy diverse and often\nimplicit task-specific evaluation rubrics. The sheer number of relevant rubrics\nleads to prohibitively high verification costs and incomplete assessments of a\nresponse, making reinforcement learning (RL) post-training with rubric-based\nrewards difficult to scale. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that often\nthe best way to combine these rubrics into one single reward is also highly\nprompt-specific. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Critic\n(RLAC), a post-training approach that addresses these challenges via dynamic\nrubric verification. Our approach employs a large language model (LLM) as a\ncritic that dynamically identifies only the most likely failure modes (e.g., a\nfactual error or unhandled edge case), which are then verified by an external\nvalidator to optimize both generator and critic jointly. By training both the\ngenerator and the critic, this game enhances the critic's error detection and\nthe generator's output quality while reducing required verifications. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that RLAC improves factual accuracy in text generation\nand correctness in code generation, while also outperforming exhaustive\nverification and reward model methods. We show that dynamic critics are more\neffective than fixed critics, showcasing the potential of RLAC for scaling RL\npost-training to free-form generation tasks.",

    "abstract": "Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) describe how Large Language Models\n(LLMs) make decisions, drawing on both external Context Knowledge (CK) and\nParametric Knowledge (PK) stored in model weights. Understanding their\ninteraction is key to assessing the grounding of NLEs, yet it remains\nunderexplored. Prior work has largely examined only single-step generation,\ntypically the final answer, and has modelled PK and CK interaction only as a\nbinary choice in a rank-1 subspace. This overlooks richer forms of interaction,\nsuch as complementary or supportive knowledge. We propose a novel rank-2\nprojection subspace that disentangles PK and CK contributions more accurately\nand use it for the first multi-step analysis of knowledge interactions across\nlonger NLE sequences. Experiments on four QA datasets and three open-weight\ninstruction-tuned LLMs show that diverse knowledge interactions are poorly\nrepresented in a rank-1 subspace but are effectively captured in our rank-2\nformulation. Our multi-step analysis reveals that hallucinated NLEs align\nstrongly with the PK direction, context-faithful ones balance PK and CK, and\nChain-of-Thought prompting for NLEs shifts generated NLEs toward CK by reducing\nPK reliance. This work provides the first framework for systematic studies of\nmulti-step knowledge interactions in LLMs through a richer rank-2 subspace\ndisentanglement.

The research integrates\nthree core perspectives: theoretical linguistics, to classify and understand\nthe nature of the errors; neurolinguistics, to contextualize them within\nreal-time language processing in the brain; and natural language processing\n(NLP), to evaluate their interpretation against linguistic errors. A\npurpose-built corpus of authentic errors of native Spanish (+500) will serve as\nthe foundation for empirical analysis. These errors will be tested against AI\nmodels such as GPT or Gemini to assess their interpretative accuracy and their\nability to generalize patterns of human linguistic behavior.

We\nconducted 4 experiments involving psychology undergraduates from 2 samples (n1\n= 70, n2 = 57) compared against GPT-simulated students (GPT-3.5: n2 = 300;\nGPT-4o: n4 = 300). Experiments 1, 2, and 3 employ individual-level network\nfeatures to predict psychometric scores for math anxiety and its facets\n(observational, social and evaluational) from the Math Anxiety Scale.\nExperiment 4 focuses on group-level perceptions extracted from human students,\nGPT-3.5 and GPT-4o's networks. Results indicate that, in students, positive\nvalence ratings and higher network degree for \"anxiety\", together with negative\nratings for \"math\", can predict higher total and evaluative math anxiety. In\ncontrast, these models do not work on GPT-based data because of differences in\nsimulated networks and psychometric scores compared to humans. These results\nwere also reconciled with differences found in the ways that high/low subgroups\nof simulated and real students framed semantically and emotionally STEM\nconcepts. High math-anxiety students collectively framed \"anxiety\" in an\nemotionally polarising way, absent in the negative perception of low\nmath-anxiety students. \"Science\" was rated positively, but contrasted against\nthe negative perception of \"math\". These findings underscore the importance of\nunderstanding concept perception and associations in managing students' math\nanxiety.",

First, to create a\nhigh-quality, difficulty-annotated dataset, we introduce a two-way distractor\ngeneration process in order to produce diverse and plausible distractors.

Second, this newly created dataset is\nleveraged to train a difficulty-controllable generation model via multitask\nlearning. The framework includes carefully designed auxiliary tasks that\nenhance the model's semantic understanding of distractors and its ability to\nestimate their difficulty.

Furthermore, while both human and synthetic\nfine-tuning data can remove safeguards, the latter preserves higher output\nquality, thus making outputs potentially more usable and dangerous.

BARD uses the thinking budget as a user-specified\ncontrol signal, allowing the model to dynamically balance reasoning performance\nand computational efficiency.

Next, we re-assess\nthree hypotheses by Arnett & Bergen (2025) for why modeling agglutinative\nlanguages results in higher perplexities than fusional languages: they look at\nmorphological alignment of tokenization, tokenization efficiency, and dataset\nsize. We show that each conclusion includes confounding factors. Finally, we\nintroduce token bigram metrics as an intrinsic way to predict the difficulty of\ncausal language modeling, and find that they are gradient proxies for\nmorphological complexity that do not require expert annotation. Ultimately, we\noutline necessities to reliably answer whether, and how, morphology relates to\nlanguage modeling.",

    "abstract": "The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models\n(LRMs) has been accompanied by an equally rapid increase of benchmarks used to\nassess them. However, due to both improved model competence resulting from\nscaling and novel training advances as well as likely many of these datasets\nbeing included in pre or post training data, results become saturated, driving\na continuous need for new and more challenging replacements. In this paper, we\ndiscuss whether surpassing a benchmark truly demonstrates reasoning ability or\nare we simply tracking numbers divorced from the capabilities we claim to\nmeasure? We present an investigation focused on three model families, OpenAI,\nAnthropic, and Google, and how their reasoning capabilities across different\nbenchmarks evolve over the years. We also analyze performance trends over the\nyears across different reasoning tasks and discuss the current situation of\nbenchmarking and remaining challenges.

    "abstract": "Natural Language Inference (NLI) models have been used in various ways to\nimprove the factuality of LLM outputs. This is typically done by applying an\nNLI model to judge whether the model output is entailed from the supposed\nevidence, triggering some corrective actions, such as beam reranking at\ninference time or RL rewards during training. While NLI models are trained to\ndetect factual inconsistencies over complete sentences, decisions in the common\nautoregressive generation architecture are made for each evolving text prefix,\nduring decoding. Addressing this setting, we generalize the entailment\ndetection task to apply over arbitrary text prefixes, and suggest its utility\nfor improving generation faithfulness. Providing suitable evaluation and\ntraining datasets for this task, we train MiniTruePrefixes, a novel specialized\nmodel that better detects factual inconsistencies over text prefixes,\noutperforming comparable baseline NLI models by 5-14 F1 points in prefix-level\nentailment. We further demonstrate that integrating MiniTruePrefixes into a\ncontrolled decoding framework substantially improves factual consistency in\nabstractive summarization. When guided by MiniTruePrefixes,\nLLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct matches the faithfulness and runtime of the 8B model from\nthe same model family, while using only half the memory.",

We decompose this position into two orthogonal\ndimensions: \\textit{spatial novelty}, which measures a paper's intellectual\ndistinctiveness from its neighbors, and \\textit{temporal novelty}, which\ncaptures its engagement with a dynamic research frontier. To operationalize\nthese concepts, we leverage Large Language Models to develop semantic isolation\nmetrics that quantify a paper's location relative to the full-text literature.\nApplying this framework to a large corpus of economics articles, we uncover a\nfundamental trade-off: these two dimensions predict systematically different\noutcomes. Temporal novelty primarily predicts citation counts, whereas spatial\nnovelty predicts disruptive impact. This distinction allows us to construct a\ntypology of semantic neighborhoods, identifying four archetypes associated with\ndistinct and predictable impact profiles. Our findings demonstrate that novelty\ncan be understood as a multidimensional construct whose different forms,\nreflecting a paper's strategic location, have measurable and fundamentally\ndistinct consequences for scientific progress.",

To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel framework designed to capture both\ndomain-specific and domain-general MGT patterns through a two-stage\nDisentangled mixturE-of-ExpeRts (DEER) architecture. First, we introduce a\ndisentangled mixture-of-experts module, in which domain-specific experts learn\nfine-grained, domain-local distinctions between human and machine-generated\ntext, while shared experts extract transferable, cross-domain features. Second,\nto mitigate the practical limitation of unavailable domain labels during\ninference, we design a reinforcement learning-based routing mechanism that\ndynamically selects the appropriate experts for each input instance,\neffectively bridging the train-inference gap caused by domain uncertainty.\nExtensive experiments on five in-domain and five out-of-domain benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that DEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving average F1-score improvements of 1.39% and 5.32% on\nin-domain and out-of-domain datasets respectively, along with accuracy gains of\n1.35% and 3.61% respectively.

Standard approaches such as\nmajority voting often collapse to spurious yet popular answers. We introduce\nSelf-Harmony, a framework built on a simple intuition: the correct answer\nshould remain stable across both an original question and its paraphrase.\nSelf-Harmony operationalizes this by employing a single model in two\ncomplementary roles: a Solver to produce answers and a Reframer to rephrase the\ninput. Based on this, we further propose a pseudo-label method: instead of\nmajority voting, it aggregates answer frequencies across these original and\nreframed views using the harmonic mean. This is a process that naturally\nselects for solutions stable under reframing, thereby avoiding the common trap\nof favoring view-dependent, spurious answers. Crucially, this requires no human\nsupervision or auxiliary models. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks,\nSelf-Harmony achieves state-of-the-art results at the label-free test-time\nsetting, ranking first in 28 of 30 settings across multiple methods.

However, existing methods often rely\non coarse visual features and uncontrolled fusion, leading to redundant or\nmisaligned representations. As a result, visual encoders often fail to capture\nsalient, item-relevant semantics, limiting their contribution in multimodal\nfusion. From an information-theoretic perspective, effective fusion should\nbalance the unique, shared, and redundant information across modalities,\npreserving complementary cues while avoiding correlation bias. This paper\npresents VLIF, a vision-language and information-theoretic fusion framework\nthat enhances multimodal recommendation through two key components.

This work\nintroduces Vote-in-Context (ViC), a generalized, training-free framework that\nre-thinks list-wise reranking and fusion as a zero-shot reasoning task for a\nVision-Language Model (VLM). The core insight is to serialize both content\nevidence and retriever metadata directly within the VLM's prompt, allowing the\nmodel to adaptively weigh retriever consensus against visual-linguistic\ncontent. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by applying it to the\nchallenging domain of cross-modal video retrieval.

ViC is evaluated both as a single-list reranker, where it\ndramatically improves the precision of individual retrievers, and as an\nensemble fuser, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines like\nCombSUM. Across video retrieval benchmarks including ActivityNet and VATEX, the\nframework establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval performance,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex visual and temporal signals\nalongside text. In zero-shot settings, ViC achieves Recall@1 scores of 87.1%\n(t2v) / 89.0% (v2t) on MSR-VTT and 99.6% (v2t) on VATEX, representing massive\ngains of up to +40 Recall@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines. We\npresent ViC as a simple, reproducible, and highly effective recipe for turning\nmodern VLMs into powerful zero-shot rerankers and fusers.

    "abstract": "Generative retrieval (GR) has gained significant attention as an effective\nparadigm that integrates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It\ngenerally consists of two stages: constructing discrete semantic identifiers\n(IDs) for documents and retrieving documents by autoregressively generating ID\ntokens. The core challenge in GR is how to construct document IDs (DocIDS) with\nstrong representational power. Good IDs should exhibit two key properties:\nsimilar documents should have more similar IDs, and each document should\nmaintain a distinct and unique ID. However, most existing methods ignore native\ncategory information, which is common and critical in E-commerce. Therefore, we\npropose a novel ID learning method, CAtegory-Tree Integrated Document\nIDentifier (CAT-ID$^2$), incorporating prior category information into the\nsemantic IDs. CAT-ID$^2$ includes three key modules: a Hierarchical Class\nConstraint Loss to integrate category information layer by layer during\nquantization, a Cluster Scale Constraint Loss for uniform ID token\ndistribution, and a Dispersion Loss to improve the distinction of reconstructed\ndocuments. These components enable CAT-ID$^2$ to generate IDs that make similar\ndocuments more alike while preserving the uniqueness of different documents'\nrepresentations. Extensive offline and online experiments confirm the\neffectiveness of our method, with online A/B tests showing a 0.33% increase in\naverage orders per thousand users for ambiguous intent queries and 0.24% for\nlong-tail queries.",

We introduce RAGSmith, a modular\nframework that treats RAG design as an end-to-end architecture search over nine\ntechnique families and 46{,}080 feasible pipeline configurations. A genetic\nsearch optimizes a scalar objective that jointly aggregates retrieval metrics\n(recall@k, mAP, nDCG, MRR) and generation metrics (LLM-Judge and semantic\nsimilarity). We evaluate on six Wikipedia-derived domains (Mathematics, Law,\nFinance, Medicine, Defense Industry, Computer Science), each with 100 questions\nspanning factual, interpretation, and long-answer types. RAGSmith finds\nconfigurations that consistently outperform naive RAG baseline by +3.8\\% on\naverage (range +1.2\\% to +6.9\\% across domains), with gains up to +12.5\\% in\nretrieval and +7.5\\% in generation. The search typically explores $\\approx\n0.2\\%$ of the space ($\\sim 100$ candidates) and discovers a robust backbone --\nvector retrieval plus post-generation reflection/revision -- augmented by\ndomain-dependent choices in expansion, reranking, augmentation, and prompt\nreordering; passage compression is never selected. Improvement magnitude\ncorrelates with question type, with larger gains on factual/long-answer mixes\nthan interpretation-heavy sets.

As these methods are\nbased on syntactic similarity, recently deep learning approaches based on\nembedding have been used for semantic similarity. In our present work, we have\nfocused on the retrieval of mathematical expressions using deep learning\napproaches. In our approach, semantic features are extracted from the MEs using\na deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) and these features have been used for\nmatching and retrieval. We have trained the network for a classification task\nwhich determines the complexity of an ME. ME complexity has been quantified in\nterms of its nested depth. Based on the nested depth, we have considered three\ncomplexity classes of MEs: Simple, Medium and Complex. After training the\nnetwork, outputs just before the the final fully connected layer are extracted\nfor all the MEs. These outputs form the semantic features of MEs and are stored\nin a database. For a given ME query, its semantic features are computed using\nthe trained DRNN and matched against the semantic feature database. Matching is\nperformed based on the standard euclidean distance and top 'k' nearest matches\nare retrieved, where 'k' is a user-defined parameter.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping numerous facets of our daily\nlives, leading widespread adoption as web-based services. Despite their\nversatility, LLMs face notable challenges, such as generating hallucinated\ncontent and lacking access to up-to-date information. Lately, to address such\nlimitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising\ndirection by generating responses grounded in external knowledge sources. A\ntypical RAG system consists of i) a retriever that probes a group of relevant\npassages from a knowledge base and ii) a generator that formulates a response\nbased on the retrieved content. However, as with other AI systems, recent\nstudies demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG, such as knowledge corruption\nattacks by injecting misleading information. In response, several defense\nstrategies have been proposed, including having LLMs inspect the retrieved\npassages individually or fine-tuning robust retrievers. While effective, such\napproaches often come with substantial computational costs.\n  In this work, we introduce RAGDefender, a resource-efficient defense\nmechanism against knowledge corruption (i.e., by data poisoning) attacks in\npractical RAG deployments. RAGDefender operates during the post-retrieval\nphase, leveraging lightweight machine learning techniques to detect and filter\nout adversarial content without requiring additional model training or\ninference. Our empirical evaluations show that RAGDefender consistently\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses across multiple models and\nadversarial scenarios: e.g., RAGDefender reduces the attack success rate (ASR)\nagainst the Gemini model from 0.89 to as low as 0.02, compared to 0.69 for\nRobustRAG and 0.24 for Discern-and-Answer when adversarial passages outnumber\nlegitimate ones by a factor of four (4x).",

However, identifying relevant documents for queries\nthat require in-depth reasoning remains a major challenge. Reasoning-intensive\nqueries often exhibit multifaceted information needs and nuanced\ninterpretations, rendering document relevance inherently context dependent. To\naddress this, we propose contextual relevance, which we define as the\nprobability that a document is relevant to a given query, marginalized over the\ndistribution of different reranking contexts it may appear in (i.e., the set of\ncandidate documents it is ranked alongside and the order in which the documents\nare presented to a reranking model). While prior works have studied methods to\nmitigate the positional bias LLMs exhibit by accounting for the ordering of\ndocuments, we empirically find that the compositions of these batches also\nplays an important role in reranking performance. To efficiently estimate\ncontextual relevance, we propose TS-SetRank, a sampling-based,\nuncertainty-aware reranking algorithm. Empirically, TS-SetRank improves nDCG@10\nover retrieval and reranking baselines by 15-25% on BRIGHT and 6-21% on BEIR,\nhighlighting the importance of modeling relevance as context-dependent.",

Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers\nare predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of\na critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note\nthat the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the\nsequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The\nframework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical\nguarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core\ncapacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the\nanalysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are\noffered.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)\ncontrol that optimizes sample generation towards an optimal trajectory through\nStein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD). MPPI is traditionally reliant on\nrandomly sampled trajectories, often by a Gaussian distribution. The result can\nlead to sample deprivation, under-representing the space of possible\ntrajectories, and yield suboptimal results. Through introducing SVGD updates in\nbetween MPPI environment steps, we present Stein-Optimized Path-Integral\nInference (SOPPI), an MPPI/SVGD algorithm that can dynamically update noise\ndistributions at runtime to shape a more optimal representation without an\nexcessive increase in computational requirements. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof our method systems ranging from a Cart-Pole to a two-dimensional bipedal\nwalking task, indicating improved performance above standard MPPI across a\nrange of hyper-parameters and demonstrate feasibility at lower particle counts.\nWe discuss the applicability of this MPPI/SVGD method to higher\ndegree-of-freedom systems, as well as its potential to new developments in\nstate-of-the-art differentiable simulators.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to translate high-level instructions\ninto the precise spatial affordances required for robotic manipulation. While\nvisual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods exist, they are often computationally\nintensive. In this work, we introduce TRACE (Textual Reasoning for Affordance\nCoordinate Extraction), a novel methodology that integrates a textual Chain of\nReasoning (CoR) into the affordance prediction process. We use this methodology\nto create the TRACE dataset, a large-scale collection created via an autonomous\npipeline that pairs instructions with explicit textual rationales. By\nfine-tuning a VLM on this data, our model learns to externalize its spatial\nreasoning before acting. Our experiments show that our TRACE-tuned model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 48.1% accuracy on the primary\nWhere2Place (W2P) benchmark (a 9.6% relative improvement) and 55.0% on the more\nchallenging W2P(h) subset. Crucially, an ablation study demonstrates that\nperformance scales directly with the amount of reasoning data used, confirming\nthe CoR's effectiveness. Furthermore, analysis of the model's attention maps\nreveals an interpretable reasoning process where focus shifts dynamically\nacross reasoning steps. This work shows that training VLMs to generate a\ntextual CoR is an effective and robust strategy for enhancing the precision,\nreliability, and interpretability of VLM-based robot control.

As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation of fBM (MA-fBM),\nwe construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the\nnon-Markovian nature of fBM.

Meanwhile, dexterous\nmanipulation tasks are inherently more difficult due to their higher degrees of\nfreedom. Massively generating feasible and trainable dexterous hand tasks\nremains an open challenge. To this end, we present GenDexHand, a generative\nsimulation pipeline that autonomously produces diverse robotic tasks and\nenvironments for dexterous manipulation.

Each task is further decomposed into\nsub-tasks to enable sequential reinforcement learning, reducing training time\nand increasing success rates.

Traditional rigid robotic hands, with\nlimited degrees of freedom and compliance, rely on complex model-based and\nheavy feedback controllers to manage such interactions. Soft robots, by\ncontrast, exhibit embodied mechanical intelligence: their underactuated\nstructures and passive flexibility of their whole body, naturally accommodate\nuncertain contacts and enable adaptive behaviors. To harness this capability,\nwe propose a lightweight actuation-space learning framework that infers\ndistributional control representations for whole-body soft robotic grasping,\ndirectly from deterministic demonstrations using a flow matching model\n(Rectified Flow),without requiring dense sensing or heavy control loops. Using\nonly 30 demonstrations (less than 8% of the reachable workspace), the learned\npolicy achieves a 97.5% grasp success rate across the whole workspace,\ngeneralizes to grasped-object size variations of +-33%, and maintains stable\nperformance when the robot's dynamic response is directly adjusted by scaling\nthe execution time from 20% to 200%.

    "abstract": "Humans naturally grasp objects with minimal level required force for\nstability, whereas robots often rely on rigid, over-squeezing control. To\nnarrow this gap, we propose a human-inspired physics-conditioned tactile method\n(Phy-Tac) for force-optimal stable grasping (FOSG) that unifies pose selection,\ntactile prediction, and force regulation. A physics-based pose selector first\nidentifies feasible contact regions with optimal force distribution based on\nsurface geometry. Then, a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model (Phy-LDM)\npredicts the tactile imprint under FOSG target. Last, a latent-space LQR\ncontroller drives the gripper toward this tactile imprint with minimal\nactuation, preventing unnecessary compression. Trained on a physics-conditioned\ntactile dataset covering diverse objects and contact conditions, the proposed\nPhy-LDM achieves superior tactile prediction accuracy, while the Phy-Tac\noutperforms fixed-force and GraspNet-based baselines in grasp stability and\nforce efficiency. Experiments on classical robotic platforms demonstrate\nforce-efficient and adaptive manipulation that bridges the gap between robotic\nand human grasping.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning of depth and ego-motion, two fundamental 3D perception\ntasks, has made significant strides in recent years. However, most methods\ntreat ego-motion as an auxiliary task, either mixing all motion types or\nexcluding depth-independent rotational motions in supervision. Such designs\nlimit the incorporation of strong geometric constraints, reducing reliability\nand robustness under diverse conditions. This study introduces a discriminative\ntreatment of motion components, leveraging the geometric regularities of their\nrespective rigid flows to benefit both depth and ego-motion estimation. Given\nconsecutive video frames, network outputs first align the optical axes and\nimaging planes of the source and target cameras. Optical flows between frames\nare transformed through these alignments, and deviations are quantified to\nimpose geometric constraints individually on each ego-motion component,\nenabling more targeted refinement. These alignments further reformulate the\njoint learning process into coaxial and coplanar forms, where depth and each\ntranslation component can be mutually derived through closed-form geometric\nrelationships, introducing complementary constraints that improve depth\nrobustness. DiMoDE, a general depth and ego-motion joint learning framework\nincorporating these designs, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple\npublic datasets and a newly collected diverse real-world dataset, particularly\nunder challenging conditions.

While deterministic deep\nnetworks achieve impressive performance under well-constrained conditions, they\nare often overconfident and fail to capture the multi-modality of the\nunderlying pose distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nprobabilistic framework that leverages flow matching on the SE(3) manifold for\nestimating 6D object pose distributions.

We achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on Real275, YCB-V, and LM-O, and demonstrate how our\nsample-based pose estimates can be leveraged in downstream robotic manipulation\ntasks such as active perception for disambiguating uncertain viewpoints or\nguiding grasp synthesis in an uncertainty-aware manner.",

Although\nexisting methods have made significant progress, two challenges remain\nunresolved. First, the modality gap between egocentric RGB observations and the\nfloor plan hinders the integration of visual and spatial information for both\nlocal obstacle avoidance and global planning. Second, accurate localization is\ncritical for navigation performance, but remains challenging at deployment in\nunseen environments due to the lack of explicit geometric alignment between RGB\ninputs and floor plans. We propose a novel diffusion-based policy, denoted as\nGlocDiff, which integrates global path planning from the floor plan with local\ndepth-aware features derived from RGB observations. The floor plan offers\nexplicit global guidance, while the depth features provide implicit geometric\ncues, collectively enabling precise prediction of optimal navigation directions\nand robust obstacle avoidance. Moreover, GlocDiff introduces noise perturbation\nduring training to enhance robustness against pose estimation errors, and we\nfind that combining this with a relatively stable VO module during inference\nresults in significantly improved navigation performance. Extensive experiments\non the FloNa benchmark demonstrate GlocDiff's efficiency and effectiveness in\nachieving superior navigation performance, and the success of real-world\ndeployments also highlights its potential for widespread practical\napplications.",

This reasoning output is used to select from a predefined library of\ndiscrete, flight-safe skills, ensuring interpretable and temporally consistent\nexecution. By decoupling symbolic reasoning from physical action, AERMANI-VLM\nmitigates hallucinated commands and prevents unsafe behavior, enabling robust\ntask completion.

While the longitudinal velocity can be measured\nusing wheel encoders, the estimation of the lateral velocity remains a key\nchallenge due to the absence of dedicated sensors in consumer-grade vehicles.\nExisting approaches often rely on simplified vehicle models, such as the\nzero-slip model, which assumes no lateral velocity at the rear axle.

    "abstract": "The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) does not only serve as the textbook\nmodel for a carnivorous plant, but also has long intrigued both botanists and\nengineers with its rapidly closing leaf trap. The trap closure is triggered by\ntwo consecutive touches of a potential prey, after which the lobes rapidly\nswitch from their concave open-state to their convex close-state and catch the\nprey within 100-500 ms after being triggered. This transformation from concave\nto convex is initiated by changes in turgor pressure and the release of stored\nelastic energy from prestresses in the concave state, which accelerate this\nmovement, leading to inversion of the lobes bi-axial curvature. Possessing two\nlow-energy states, the leaves can be characterized as bistable systems. With\nour research, we seek to deepen the understanding of Venus flytrap motion\nmechanics and apply its principles to the design of an artificial bistable lobe\nactuator. We identified geometrical characteristics, such as dimensional ratios\nand the thickness gradient in the lobe, and transferred these to two 3D-printed\nbistable actuator models. One actuator parallels the simulated geometry of a\nVenus flytrap leaf, the other is a lobe model designed with CAD. Both models\ndisplay concave-convex bi-stability and snap close. These demonstrators are the\nfirst step in the development of an artificial Venus flytrap that mimics the\nmechanical behavior of the biological model and can be used as a soft fast\ngripper.",

    "abstract": "Soft robotic systems have gained widespread attention due to their inherent\nflexibility, adaptability, and safety, making them well-suited for varied\napplications. Among bioinspired designs, earthworm locomotion has been\nextensively studied for its efficient peristaltic motion, enabling movement in\nconfined and unstructured environments. Existing earthworm-inspired robots\nprimarily utilize pneumatic actuation due to its high force-to-weight ratio and\nease of implementation. However, these systems often rely on bulky,\npower-intensive electronic control units, limiting their practicality. In this\nwork, we present an electronics-free, earthworm-inspired pneumatic robot\nutilizing a modified Pneumatic Logic Gate (PLG) design. By integrating\npreconfigured PLG units with bellow actuators, we achieved a plug-and-play\nstyle modular system capable of peristaltic locomotion without external\nelectronic components. The proposed design reduces system complexity while\nmaintaining efficient actuation. We characterize the bellow actuators under\ndifferent operating conditions and evaluate the robots locomotion performance.\nOur findings demonstrate that the modified PLG-based control system effectively\ngenerates peristaltic wave propagation, achieving autonomous motion with\nminimal deviation. This study serves as a proof of concept for the development\nof electronics-free, peristaltic soft robots. The proposed system has potential\nfor applications in hazardous environments, where untethered, adaptable\nlocomotion is critical.

Both open-loop and\nclosed-loop tests are conducted for a comprehensive evaluation of planning\nperformance. Experimental results demonstrate that the $E^{3}AD$ paradigm\nsignificantly enhances the end-to-end planning performance of baseline models.\nAblation studies further validate the contribution of driving cognition and the\neffectiveness of comparative learning process.

In this paper, we propose a transfer-based framework for dexterous\ngrasp generation, leveraging a conditional diffusion model to transfer\nhigh-quality grasps from shape templates to novel objects within the same\ncategory. Specifically, we reformulate the grasp transfer problem as the\ngeneration of an object contact map, incorporating object shape similarity and\ntask specifications into the diffusion process. To handle complex shape\nvariations, we introduce a dual mapping mechanism, capturing intricate\ngeometric relationship between shape templates and novel objects. Beyond the\ncontact map, we derive two additional object-centric maps, the part map and\ndirection map, to encode finer contact details for more stable grasps. We then\ndevelop a cascaded conditional diffusion model framework to jointly transfer\nthese three maps, ensuring their intra-consistency. Finally, we introduce a\nrobust grasp recovery mechanism, identifying reliable contact points and\noptimizing grasp configurations efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe superiority of our proposed method.

However,\npath planning for these robots in unknown environments presents a significant\nchallenge, requiring a delicate balance between efficient exploration and\nrobust planning. Traditional path planners, which treat the environment as a\ngeometric grid, often suffer from redundant searches and are prone to failure\nin complex scenarios due to their lack of semantic understanding. To overcome\nthese limitations, we reframe path planning in unknown environments as a\nsemantic reasoning task. We introduce a Semantic Agent for Tensegrity robots\n(SATPlanner) driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). SATPlanner leverages\nhigh-level environmental comprehension to generate efficient and reliable\nplanning strategies.At the core of SATPlanner is an Adaptive Observation Window\nmechanism, inspired by the \"fast\" and \"slow\" thinking paradigms of LLMs. This\nmechanism dynamically adjusts the perceptual field of the agent: it narrows for\nrapid traversal of open spaces and expands to reason about complex obstacle\nconfigurations. This allows the agent to construct a semantic belief of the\nenvironment, enabling the search space to grow only linearly with the path\nlength (O(L)) while maintaining path quality. We extensively evaluate\nSATPlanner in 1,000 simulation trials, where it achieves a 100% success rate,\noutperforming other real-time planning algorithms. Critically, SATPlanner\nreduces the search space by 37.2% compared to the A* algorithm while achieving\ncomparable, near-optimal path lengths. Finally, the practical feasibility of\nSATPlanner is validated on a physical spherical tensegrity robot prototype.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic\nlearning, enabling training on large-scale, cross-embodiment data and\nfine-tuning for specific robots. However, state-of-the-art autoregressive VLAs\nstruggle with multi-robot collaboration. We introduce embodiment transfer\nlearning, denoted as ET-VLA, a novel framework for efficient and effective\ntransfer of pre-trained VLAs to multi-robot. ET-VLA's core is Synthetic\nContinued Pretraining (SCP), which uses synthetically generated data to warm up\nthe model for the new embodiment, bypassing the need for real human\ndemonstrations and reducing data collection costs. SCP enables the model to\nlearn correct actions and precise action token numbers. Following SCP, the\nmodel is fine-tuned on target embodiment data. To further enhance the model\nperformance on multi-embodiment, we present the Embodied Graph-of-Thought\ntechnique, a novel approach that formulates each sub-task as a node, that\nallows the VLA model to distinguish the functionalities and roles of each\nembodiment during task execution. Our work considers bimanual robots, a simple\nversion of multi-robot to verify our approaches. We validate the effectiveness\nof our method on both simulation benchmarks and real robots covering three\ndifferent bimanual embodiments.

This paper explores a training method for\ndomain adaptation to adapt PilotNet, an end-to-end deep learning-based model,\nfor left-hand driving conditions using real-world Australian highway data. Four\ntraining methods were evaluated: (1) a baseline model trained on U.S.\nright-hand driving data, (2) a model trained on flipped U.S. data, (3) a model\npretrained on U.S. data and then fine-tuned on Australian highways, and (4) a\nmodel pretrained on flipped U.S. data and then finetuned on Australian\nhighways. This setup examines whether incorporating flipped data enhances the\nmodel adaptation by providing an initial left-hand driving alignment. The paper\ncompares model performance regarding steering prediction accuracy and\nattention, using saliency-based analysis to measure attention shifts across\nsignificant road regions. Results show that pretraining on flipped data alone\nworsens prediction stability due to misaligned feature representations, but\nsignificantly improves adaptation when followed by fine-tuning, leading to\nlower prediction error and stronger focus on left-side cues. To validate this\napproach across different architectures, the same experiments were done on\nResNet, which confirmed similar adaptation trends.

For this purpose, a passive\n2-D global relocalization framework is proposed. It estimates the global pose\nefficiently and reliably from a single LiDAR scan and an occupancy grid map\nwhile the robot remains stationary, thereby enhancing the long-term autonomy of\nmobile robots. The proposed framework casts global relocalization as a\nnon-convex problem and solves it via the multi-hypothesis scheme with batched\nmulti-stage inference and early termination, balancing completeness and\nefficiency. The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), under traversability\nconstraints, asymptotically covers the reachable space to generate sparse,\nuniformly distributed feasible positional hypotheses, fundamentally reducing\nthe sampling space. The hypotheses are preliminarily ordered by the proposed\nScan Mean Absolute Difference (SMAD), a coarse beam-error level metric that\nfacilitates the early termination by prioritizing high-likelihood candidates.\nThe SMAD computation is optimized for non-panoramic scans. And the\nTranslation-Affinity Scan-to-Map Alignment Metric (TAM) is proposed for\nreliable orientation selection at hypothesized positions and accurate final\npose evaluation to mitigate degradation in conventional likelihood-field\nmetrics under translational uncertainty induced by sparse hypotheses, as well\nas non-panoramic LiDAR scan and environmental changes. Real-world experiments\non a resource-constrained mobile robot with non-panoramic LiDAR scan\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in both\nglobal relocalization success rate and computational efficiency.",

We\nconjecture that environment dynamics are embodiment-invariant, and that world\nmodels capturing these dynamics can provide a unified interface across\nembodiments. To learn such a unified world model, the crucial step is to design\nstate and action representations that abstract away embodiment-specific details\nwhile preserving control relevance. To this end, we represent different\nembodiments (e.g., human hands and robot hands) as sets of 3D particles and\ndefine actions as particle displacements, creating a shared representation for\nheterogeneous data and control problems. A graph-based world model is then\ntrained on exploration data from diverse simulated robot hands and real human\nhands, and integrated with model-based planning for deployment on novel\nhardware. Experiments on rigid and deformable manipulation tasks reveal three\nfindings: (i) scaling to more training embodiments improves generalization to\nunseen ones, (ii) co-training on both simulated and real data outperforms\ntraining on either alone, and (iii) the learned models enable effective control\non robots with varied degrees of freedom.

Since\ndata augmentation plays a crucial role in the success of CL, previous works\nhave designed augmentation methods to remove noisy interactions between users\nand items in order to generate effective augmented views. However, the\nambiguity in defining ''noisiness'' presents a persistent risk of losing core\ninformation and generating unreliable data views, while increasing the overall\ncomplexity of augmentation. In this paper, we propose Simple Collaborative\nAugmentation for Recommendation (SCAR), a novel and intuitive augmentation\nmethod designed to maximize the effectiveness of CL for GCF. Instead of\nremoving information, SCAR leverages collaborative signals extracted from\nuser-item interactions to generate pseudo-interactions, which are then either\nadded to or used to replace existing interactions. This results in more robust\nrepresentations while avoiding the pitfalls of overly complex augmentation\nmodules. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets and show that SCAR\noutperforms previous CL-based GCF methods as well as other state-of-the-art\nself-supervised learning approaches across key evaluation metrics.

Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer\narchitecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while enabling\ncross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we propose training techniques such\nas independent noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow\nmatching loss, which enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a\nbidirectional manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space.\nFurthermore, based on the decoupled training framework, we introduce a sampling\nmethod where we sample action and vision tokens asynchronously at different\nrates, which shows improvement through inference-time scaling. Through\nexperiments on simulated benchmarks such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up\nto 6% gains over a standard VLA baseline and implicit world-modeling methods,\nwith our inference-time scaling approach providing an additional 2-5% gain on\nsuccess rate. On real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST outperforms\nbaselines in success rate by 13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond\nsimulation.

The first relies on dense human annotations through\nbehavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that\ncan take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which\noften collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on\ndomain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that\nintegrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.\nInstead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to\nintervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing\nprior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it\npossible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable\ntrajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter\nout sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these\ncomponents enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon\nenvironments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using\nInnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5\nmodel on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the\nuntrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human\ninteraction.

    "abstract": "AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis\nformation, experiment design, coding, execution, and analysis, yet existing\nbenchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings. To address this gap, we\nintroduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end\nassessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It\ncomprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss\nDesign, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable\nartifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and\nuncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research\nenvironment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon\nexecution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a\nlightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable\nplanning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.\nOur experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in\ncode-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks\nand long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,\nand overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over\n11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the\nbenchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the\nnext generation of code-based research benchmark.",

Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon\nemissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the\nsignificance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate\nchange, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality\nforest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground\nbiomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the\nleast understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for\naccurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis\nof AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning\ndatasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches\nSVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning\nwere used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable\nselection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning\napproach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results\nindicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height:\nElev\\.minimum, Elev\\.L3, lev\\.MAD.mode, Elev\\.mode, Elev\\.MAD\\.median, and\nElev\\.skewness, are important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD, while\nLeaf Area Index, canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and\nfull-waveform signal energy emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values\nestimated from ten permanent tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste\nprovince ranged from 26.02 Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha.

Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases\nfor the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced\nindexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine\nlearning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi\npatterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high\nscan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of\ncrystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results.

We design a JSON\ntemplate to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically\ntailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference\nworkflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs capability to align and\ncompare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on\nseveral recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,\nweaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding.

In practice, however,\nretrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations\nshaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We study two such\nbiases. First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from\nprevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text\nretrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images\nculturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in\ntext-to-image retrieval. Results show that explicit alignment is a more\neffective strategy for mitigating prevalence bias. However, association bias\nremains a distinct and more challenging problem. These findings suggest that\nachieving truly equitable multimodal systems requires targeted strategies\nbeyond simple data scaling and that bias arising from cultural association may\nbe treated as a more challenging problem than one arising from linguistic\nprevalence.",

    "abstract": "Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate\nword pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's\nhigh degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches\nhave significantly advanced performance on this task.\n  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization\nthat frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach\noperates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization\npattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,\nconditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is\nits use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text\nas an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the\ninput's vector representation.\n  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we\ndemonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying\non complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting\nwhere the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided\ncandidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic\narchitectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield\nsignificant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.\nThese findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for\naccurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal retrieval systems are expected to operate in a semantic space,\nagnostic to the language or cultural origin of the query. In practice, however,\nretrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations\nshaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We study two such\nbiases. First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from\nprevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text\nretrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images\nculturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in\ntext-to-image retrieval. Results show that explicit alignment is a more\neffective strategy for mitigating prevalence bias. However, association bias\nremains a distinct and more challenging problem. These findings suggest that\nachieving truly equitable multimodal systems requires targeted strategies\nbeyond simple data scaling and that bias arising from cultural association may\nbe treated as a more challenging problem than one arising from linguistic\nprevalence.",

Our research investigates how different\nlevels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,\nextending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories\ninto a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view\nvideos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),\nor high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we\ntriangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and\nuncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and\nqualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.",

Existing datasets in this domain are\ntypically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the\nspatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this\nlimitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with\nrich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million\nflights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along\nsequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and\n(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport\nresource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset\nis carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and\nstrict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine\nlearning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including\nregression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,\nserving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph\nmodalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to\nfacilitate adoption.

    "abstract": "Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in\napplications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and\nrecommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are\nlimited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,\nreal-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.\nFor example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses\ndifferently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying\nsimilarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under\nscenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling\nthe imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are\nunderrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering\nof Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets\nfrom multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize\nutility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose\nOff-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on\noffline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that\nexplicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the\nsecond challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting\nwith active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited\nnumber of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster\nstructure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,\nA$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative\ndimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively\ncollected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we\nvalidate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets.",

We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

Furthermore, it incorporates a\nhybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with\nintermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By\nadaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage\nbehavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency\ncaused by expert swap-ins.

    "abstract": "Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a\nscalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless\nmultiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines.",

Unlike prior studies that attribute\nthis text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction\ntuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal\narchitecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual\nKeys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned\nduring language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive\nsystematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to\ntheir under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this\nhypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their\ndistributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative\n(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that\nvisual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention\nspace.

Aeolus addresses this\nlimitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with\nrich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million\nflights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along\nsequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and\n(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport\nresource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset\nis carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and\nstrict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine\nlearning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including\nregression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,\nserving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph\nmodalities.

    "abstract": "Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted\nprobabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class\nfrequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong\ncalibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities\nto be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing\napproaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,\nwhich makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of\nthe feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant\nin high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are\nexactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this\nmain shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.\nFirst, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its\nrelationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the\npitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local\ncalibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local\ncalibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted\nprobabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon\ndistance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing\nmulticlass calibration techniques.",

Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver\ndemonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our\ntrained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our\nmodel achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two\ndistinct tools of different lengths.

We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of\nrelations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer\nlanguage models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,\nprovide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual\nlandscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing\nthese questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context\nengineering and sketch its promising future.

However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on\nQwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks\ndemonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning\ncapabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.",

Code review serves as an effective practice that enables\ndevelopers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.\nTo streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review\napproaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly\nadvanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing\nmodels primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in\nidentifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.\nMoreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues\nfaces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation\nmetrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new\napproach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve\nsecurity-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a\ndataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.\nLeveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments\nthat can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with\nour proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in\nLLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG\ntechnique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security\nknowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric\ndesigned to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security\nissues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the\noverall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.",

In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates\nsignificantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only\nlimited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical\nanalysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing\nprocess, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.\nAlthough this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains\nhighly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability\nand improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data\nmanifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation\nframework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold\nlearning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,\nlow-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the\nclassification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust\nperformance under universal adversarial attacks.

Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer\nfrom inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to\nlabel inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical\ncomplexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches\nemploy static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label\nbackdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked\nsample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,\nfundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The\ncore innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three\ncomponents: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target\nsample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss\nmaintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box\ntesting is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined\nbackdoor behaviors.

The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization.

This\ncollaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and\ninterpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for\nformal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable\nproof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can\nadvance the frontier of mathematical discovery.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining\ncausal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed\ninterventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional\ndata. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We\nevaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating\ninterventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures\nconsistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also\nfacilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be\ncostly to identify.",

    "abstract": "Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from\nsurveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because\nrecovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable\ndownstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed\nto satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual\nrealism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.",

To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates.

Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,\nproving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant\nlatent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,\ntoken granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's\ncompositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the\nexistence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant\nalignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations\nover atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard\nnegatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal\nencoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to\nvisual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition\noperators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.",

In this study, we conduct an\nearly evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based\ngames as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,\nand Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics\nto assess performance across different task types.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.\nThis capability has driven their application to high-dimensional\nmulti-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often\nemploy an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the\ndiffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a\nblack-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the\ndiffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate\nsamples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG\nperforms weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according\nto the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling\nstrategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to\nour desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the\nmulti-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood\ninterpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional\nmulti-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective\nmolecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single\ngeneration pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline\noptimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.\nNotably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can\nbe integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.",

This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,\nunguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking\npivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We\naddress these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which\ndynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and\nemploys graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning\nsignals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward\nhigh-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware\ncredit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's\nstrategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench\nbenchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success\nrate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines.

    "abstract": "Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving\ntheir general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable\nartificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

    "abstract": "With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is\nessential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone\nto hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may\ncause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection\ntypes present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and\ncross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous\nintersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable\nTSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning\nframework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency\nscenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to\ndistill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the\nreliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this\npaper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a\nReward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3\nadaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with\nenvironment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed\nreward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies\nacross heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17\nto 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC\nreduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle\nwaiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic\nstudies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets\ncapture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique\nchallenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot\nreasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire\ndata or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains\nunderexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,\nSPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such\ndata integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves\nscientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on\nhow to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by\nintroducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a\nbenchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,\nrespondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and\nmultiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing\nan effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%\npoints compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a\nlightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further\nimprovements of 3-4% points on average.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to\nreducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation\nbenchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant\nchunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only\nlocalized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and\nbaselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,\nwith the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that\npreserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates\nLLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates\naggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,\nGlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,\nvalidating the effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable\nways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data\nencodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,\nlength or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without\npre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human\nFeedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.\nWIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring\nand (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7\ndatasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that\naccount for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by\nblack-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method\nfor practitioners to better understand and use preference data.",

    "abstract": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their\npractical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

We propose a\nnovel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and\naccuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast\ntissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these\npatterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated\nour method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that\nthe proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three\nclassification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype\nclassification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI\nresearch agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,\na novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic\ncombination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to\naddress complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several\nkey innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert\nguidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,\n3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and\nLLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution\ninfrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has\nbeen evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine\nlearning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM\nAgent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human\ninterpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\\%), 43.56\\% on MLE-Bench\n(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new\nstate-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.\nBeyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both\nlarge-scale enterprise R\\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,\nwhere it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and\ndeliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal\nimpact.",

We propose\nReasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits\nreasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and\nrefines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a\nbrief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop\nreasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and\nconsolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,\nrequiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.\nEvaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning\ncurriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis\nindicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation\nincreases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems.

However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily\nfeature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of\nthese systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.",

SAFE integrates various data domains to\nstratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:\nterritory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or\nwater). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual\nstratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual\ncountry).

We use this to\nseed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different\nlead times for various climatic variables.

    "abstract": "Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and\nhigher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the\npotential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and\ncongestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.",

    "abstract": "There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation\nand 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a\npromising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce\nimmersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance\nthis technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically\nbased rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to\nrepurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,\nand PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize\nappearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we\npresent OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and\nefficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for\na broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,\ngeneration, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic\npanorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse\nindoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene\ngeneration, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic\nvirtual world generation.",

    "abstract": "Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from\ncasual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods\ntypically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive\nand brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches\nmitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera\ntrajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby\ndepicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this\ntrajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene\ndynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a\npose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory\nprediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby\nseparating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video\ninpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising\nrealistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing\nregions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D\nannotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal\nautoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and\nextends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at\nbounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation\nand sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and\nqualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and\nimproved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,\nadvancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.",

Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global\nclassification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while\ncross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain\ngap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a\nhybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large\ngeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification\ntask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly\nencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with\nembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of\nground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas\nspanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach can localize within 200m more than 68\\% of queries of a dataset\ncovering a large part of Europe.

In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most\nnotably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization\nin modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can\nleverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework\nthat systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key\npillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that\nintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions\nfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen\nmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed\nfor fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and\ngeneralization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human\nevaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

We design a JSON\ntemplate to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically\ntailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference\nworkflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and\ncompare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on\nseveral recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,\nweaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding.

    "abstract": "The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to\ntypically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of\ninformation can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.\nScene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In\nthis work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal\nNetwork-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks\nthrough two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one\nalgorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,\nselecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background\nscene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into\ninitial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on\nchallenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall\nimprovement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,\nour experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion\nhandling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and\nunoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is\ninterpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future\ndirections for research and practical applications.",

Manual quality assessment\nis time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for robust automated\nsolutions. In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image\nQuality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity\nlevels. BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust\nper-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure\nconsistent exposure to underrepresented classes.

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,\nclimate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer\nvision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,\nhas advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical\nproblems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical\nflow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,\nwhich limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based\napproaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in\ncomputer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We\npresent the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models\non RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and\nFl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer\naccuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the\nspatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the\nArctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing\nconsistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical\nflow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy\ncompared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote\nsensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing\nmotion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,\noffering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.",

While recent breakthroughs in\nComputer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable\nprogress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains\nfragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative\nintelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking\nanalysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as\nVision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI\nrather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically\nreviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,\nand Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their\ncapabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their\npotential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception\nframeworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that\nmoves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,\nand cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a\ncross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze\ncutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to\nhybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven\napproaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language\nModels (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey\ndelivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future\nopportunities.",

We evaluate\nour tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and\nobject detection.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA\nleveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,\ntheir generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain\nscenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to\nlarge distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation\nmechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or\nbespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across\ndiverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for\ncross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while\nrequiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to\ndecouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight\nmodules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual\nadapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a\nVisual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically\ninjected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone\nmodel. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without\nretraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on\nMedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH\nprovides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling\npractical deployment across diverse application domains.",

A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining\nglobal scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.\nExtensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and\nOpen Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy\nover baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show\nrobust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic\nfusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and\ninterpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot\ngeneralization in dynamic real-world settings.",

    "abstract": "Olive tree biovolume estimation is a key task in precision agriculture,\nsupporting yield prediction and resource management, especially in\nMediterranean regions severely impacted by climate-induced stress. This study\npresents a comparative analysis of three deep learning models U-Net,\nYOLOv11m-seg, and Mask RCNN for segmenting olive tree crowns and their shadows\nin ultra-high resolution UAV imagery. The UAV dataset, acquired over\nVicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks. Building\non these annotations, the methodology emphasizes spatial feature extraction and\nrobust segmentation; per-tree biovolume is then estimated by combining crown\nprojected area with shadow-derived height using solar geometry. In testing,\nMask R-CNN achieved the best overall accuracy (F1 = 0.86; mIoU = 0.72), while\nYOLOv11m-seg provided the fastest throughput (0.12 second per image). The\nestimated biovolumes spanned from approximately 4 to 24 cubic meters,\nreflecting clear structural differences among trees. These results indicate\nMask R-CNN is preferable when biovolume accuracy is paramount, whereas\nYOLOv11m-seg suits large-area deployments where speed is critical; U-Net\nremains a lightweight, high-sensitivity option. The framework enables accurate,\nscalable orchard monitoring and can be further strengthened with DEM or DSM\nintegration and field calibration for operational decision support.",

    "abstract": "Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),\nplays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical\napplications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,\nthe global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect\nthe high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine\nbones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,\nwhich deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network\n(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a\nscale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional\nlong-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the\nconsistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic\nlevel affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform\nsemantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a\nTransformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a\nfeature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method\nimproves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior\nsegmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process.

Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability\nof pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous\nregions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.\nHowever, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can\nonly pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to\nidentify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment\nbetween image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving\nsub-optimal localization performance.

Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel\nframework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,\nwhich consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and\nMulti-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics\ninto multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and\nconcatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and\nmulti-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align\nwith corresponding visual regions.

    "abstract": "Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for\nadapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on\nlabeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt\ncalibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel\nTPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the\ndistribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable\nprompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular\ndistance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate\naverage calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through\nextensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,\nour approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural\ndistribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide\nextensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding\nof A-TPT.

    "abstract": "Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.\nWhile recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image\nsegmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their\neffectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we\npropose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel\ntwo-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation\naccuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior\nnetwork and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse\nlocalization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial\nguidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises\nfour essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric\ncross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to\nexisting segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from\nsurveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because\nrecovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable\ndownstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed\nto satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual\nrealism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged\nand elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental\nhealth. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early\ndetection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently\nestablished based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer\n(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of\nexisting methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One\npotential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of\nbackbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them\n(\\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global\nfeature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to\neffectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the\ntheory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm\ntransforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via\na set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the\naggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively\ntune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the\nperformance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly\navailable DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nhybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability\nfor feature fusion and decision-making.",

We address this gap with a unified framework\nintegrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our\nbenchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and\n$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to\n$300$ imaging tasks.

Ground truth scheduling annotations are\nprovided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first\nlarge-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.\nBuilding upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based\nscheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A\ndedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and\noperational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative\nlearning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution\nfor AEOS constellation scheduling.

Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images\nby learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain\nlimited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection\nfurther affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex\nscenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion\nunder the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and\nvisible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the\nquantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,\nwhich leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational\nbottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and\ninformation decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal\ninformation, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural\ndetails. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion\nmodel is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical\nguidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at\ndifferent stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the\nintrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nfusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple\ndatasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully\ndemonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing\ninspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and\ndetail quality.",

    "abstract": "Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,\nwhile most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its\ngenerative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A\nmajor obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with\nManhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres\nsuch as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address\nthis gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse\ndocument layouts, covering six common document types and comprising\ncontemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing\nmethods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences\ncoherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage\nCoarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from\nOmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the\nknowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on\nmultiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing\nlayout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,\nmodels, and dataset will be publicly released.",

    "abstract": "The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal\nperformance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur\nin a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the\nsustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the\nsupply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential\nelement in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in\nthe context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed\nto analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to\npropose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric\nnetwork (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This\nnetwork is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to\nderive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the\nproposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The\nSupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction\nof delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The\nproduct classification and edge classification are performed using the\nSupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An\naverage accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk\nmanagement. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for\nsustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4\nproduct relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%\nis attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an\naverage improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer\nanimation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this\ntask presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature\nof sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of\nlarge-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with\nheuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in\ngeneralizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach\nleveraging a \"learn from synthesis\" strategy. First, a diffusion model is\ntrained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human\nposes, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process\nenables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k\naccurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building\non this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for\nestimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework\ncombines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch\nfeature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose\nestimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee\ngeometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses\nwhile preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and\nsubjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses\nprevious ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.",

Researchers have investigated various\nmethods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including\nblur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are\noften of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we\npropose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework\nusing Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion\nrepresentations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality\nfrom a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key\ncomponents: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale\nfeature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new\ntraining method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained\nmotion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a\nmotion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory.

Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)\nplays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no\ncomprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables\nscenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG\nbenchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse\nset of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn\nconversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to\nmimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to\nreflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of\nimage-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing\ninformation dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:\nsingle-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn\nconversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for\nboth image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that\nstraightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM\nsingle- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry\nsolutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for\nimprovement.

In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the\nmost common means of local transport.

To meet diverse application demands, we\ninstantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for\nstrictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a\nlimited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a\nbidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources\nare less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nadaptability of our model across these different scenarios.

    "abstract": "Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.\nPrevious part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens\noften suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts\nan explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all\nparts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to\ndegraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that\ncombines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding\nbox layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that\nimplicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little\ngeometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed\nfull-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,\neach part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,\nenabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a\ncenter-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when\nexchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby\nmaintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part\ndata, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to\ndate with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will\nrelease all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part\ngeneration.",

    "abstract": "Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating\nsignificant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class\nactivation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify\nregions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.\nFurthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more\ngeneralizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.\nHowever, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated\ndirectly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains\nlimited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations\nenriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In\nthis work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D\nindoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information\nderived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve\nframe association performance.

    "abstract": "Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in\nthe research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily\nfeature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of\nthese systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.",

Our approach iteratively refines 3D\nGaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization\nstrategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity\nand pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization\ninto two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via\ndifferentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses\nusing a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and\nphotometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection\nerrors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations\nand sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle.

    "abstract": "As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves\nthe cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,\ncurrent OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS\ninvolves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,\nand (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a\ncritical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,\ncompiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we\npresent OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured\nmanagement and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly\nintegrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models\n(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we\nconstruct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,\nwhich is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,\ncleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M\nsingle-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent\nleverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in\nretrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior\nperformance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,\nsurpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,\nGPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can\neffectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS\nresearch.

We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric.

    "abstract": "As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and\nmore confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their\ngeneral knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.\nTherefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a\ncrucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the\nalignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which\nmodels learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at\nwhich stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's\npost-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training\nalgorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts\nduring training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different\nsizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization\ndatasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a\nmodel's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these\nvalues. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of values, we find that different preference\noptimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when\npreference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into\nhow values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,\nas well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization\nto improve model alignment to human values.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for\nthe first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across\nvarious scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement\nlearning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an\nexpressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a\nfiner-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited\nfinite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware\nefficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)\ntransition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the\ngeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical\ndelta rule.\n  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total\nparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention\n(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear\noutperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while\nreducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding\nthroughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be\na drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior\nperformance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output\nlengths.\n  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM\nimplementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model\ncheckpoints.",

Specifically, Evontree extracts\ndomain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core\nontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled\nfine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with\nLlama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both\nunmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%\nimprovement in accuracy.

While DecLLM is overall\nmore compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling\nand context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM\nachieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while\nenjoying substantially better inference efficiency.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in\nHernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer\nlanguage models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of\nrelations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer\nlanguage models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

    "abstract": "Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate\nword pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's\nhigh degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches\nhave significantly advanced performance on this task.\n  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization\nthat frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach\noperates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization\npattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,\nconditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is\nits use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text\nas an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the\ninput's vector representation.\n  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we\ndemonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying\non complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting\nwhere the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided\ncandidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic\narchitectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield\nsignificant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.\nThese findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for\naccurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.",

Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and\nconsensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were\ntested for rating the performance of the triage tool.\n  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The\nhighest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).\nThe average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).\nLlama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater\nprecision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the\nideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3\nEnsemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522\n(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between\nTop-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).\n  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a\nmore consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective\nevaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.",

We further\npropose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions\namong an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.\nThe model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.\nDySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling\n1,072 tasks.

    "abstract": "Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social\nrelations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are\nfundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which\ncontexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,\nprovide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual\nlandscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing\nthese questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context\nengineering and sketch its promising future.

However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process.

In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent\nframework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging\na diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a\nstructured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.\nDuring the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each\nembodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines\nan initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates\na plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed\noracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this\nexecution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using\nthe specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before\nre-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks\ndemonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms\nstate-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle\naccuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The\nimproved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug\ndetection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases\nfrom 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of\nautomated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.",

OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.\nThe data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge\ndimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K\nentries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained\ncategories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and\n20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of\nquestion formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid\nfoundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.\nExtensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs\nreveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro\nsurpassed 60\\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the\nbest-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\\%.\nThese results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the\nchallenges of applying LLMs in education.",

In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for\nautomatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including\ntheir internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method\nconstructs a \"language model graph\" that maps relationships between models from\nthe semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community\ndetection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse\nLLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent\ngroups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with\nspecific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines\non downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of\nmanually-curated teams based on known model specializations.

We instead analyze\ninternal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)\nexternal signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;\n(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than\nincorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct\nresponses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones\ndiverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding\n(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using\nactivation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on\ninternal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables\nearly correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports\naggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable\nanswers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where\nmajority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to\nreducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation\nbenchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant\nchunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only\nlocalized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and\nbaselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,\nwith the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that\npreserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates\nLLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates\naggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,\nGlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,\nvalidating the effectiveness of our method.",

While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,\nlength or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without\npre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human\nFeedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.\nWIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring\nand (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7\ndatasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that\naccount for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by\nblack-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction.

    "abstract": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their\npractical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

Second, it\nincorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming\ncontests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of\nLLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even\nadvanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting\nthe difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3\nreach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written\ncodes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation\nAPI to support further research.",

It aligns with modern recommendation\nscenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to\nchallenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12\nrepresentative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a\nprompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test.

However, its effect on model's\nrobustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on\nout-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods.",

Their prevalence, features, and\nclinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and\ndeploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in\nradiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior\nthyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from\nJuly 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline\nidentified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from\nmultiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of\nITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer\ndiagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related\nfactors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%\nwomen), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more\nlikely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was\nordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were\nmore likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule\ncharacteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other\nfeatures in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients\nwithout ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,\nbiopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were\npapillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were\ncommon and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,\nlow-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer\noverdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective\nfollow-up.",

Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global\nclassification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while\ncross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain\ngap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a\nhybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large\ngeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification\ntask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly\nencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with\nembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of\nground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas\nspanning multiple countries.

PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty\nover linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise\nshifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that\nTransformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on\nunseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published\nclassical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up\nto $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.\nSurprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can\nbe reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented\ntogether during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying\nstructures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with\nmodulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for\nnear-perfect prediction grows as $\\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization\nenters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \\geq\n2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating\na critical necessity for curriculum learning.

    "abstract": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

    "abstract": "This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to\nguide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to\ndesired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired\nprompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust\nactivations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows\nfor fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without\nmodifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our\nsteering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original\nVLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise\nactivation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring\npre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.\nFurthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a\nmultimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and\nevaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing\nintervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for\nVLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through\nactivation engineering.",

    "abstract": "In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been\npredominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between\nentities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

    "abstract": "The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a\ntreatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major\napproaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)\napproach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a\nclassification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population\nwelfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by\nmaximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on\nregression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect\n(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.\nThis study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are\nbased on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an\nexact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of\nthe policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in\nseveral respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common\nconditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization\nmethod for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally\nefficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step\ntypically required in EWM.",

    "abstract": "Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a\nscalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless\nmultiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines.",

Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the\nalignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which\nmodels learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at\nwhich stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's\npost-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training\nalgorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts\nduring training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different\nsizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization\ndatasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a\nmodel's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these\nvalues. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of values, we find that different preference\noptimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when\npreference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into\nhow values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,\nas well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization\nto improve model alignment to human values.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for\nthe first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across\nvarious scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement\nlearning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an\nexpressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a\nfiner-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited\nfinite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware\nefficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)\ntransition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the\ngeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical\ndelta rule.\n  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total\nparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention\n(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear\noutperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while\nreducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding\nthroughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be\na drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior\nperformance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output\nlengths.\n  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM\nimplementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model\ncheckpoints.",

We introduce\n\\textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework\nfor automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks\n(GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits\nsequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward\nfunction that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth,\nand gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse\nensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of \\textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of\nsimulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz\ndesign for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image\nclassification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing.

    "abstract": "In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain\ndistribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment\nconditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level\nobservations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely\non key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful\nlearning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de\nfacto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action\nthat results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an\nenergy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world\nsystems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit\nnon-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this\npaper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is\ncapable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in\nstark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is\nconstructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.\nWe showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single\ncells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate\nvelocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better\nmatch both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands\nflow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the\nmodeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems.

Therefore, the only scalable and viable\nsolution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected\nfrom diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,\nbased on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to\nrun. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to\ntime series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based\napproaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper\nstudies the performance of time series classification methods used as model\nselection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations\nderived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we\npropose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series\nclassification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results\ndemonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly\ndetection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution\ntime. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and\nefficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and\nrepresents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection\nstep in general AutoML pipelines.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is\nbecoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often\nignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.\nTo overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the\nparameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the\nminimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance\nbetween the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which\ntakes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based\noptimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed\nmethod provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein\ndistance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced\nnonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than\nor comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,\nwhile maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via\ncontrol points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that\ncombines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.\nProspects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian\ndistributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and\nadapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating\nsurfaces and more complex structures.",

    "abstract": "Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted\nprobabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class\nfrequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong\ncalibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities\nto be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing\napproaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,\nwhich makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of\nthe feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant\nin high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are\nexactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this\nmain shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.\nFirst, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its\nrelationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the\npitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local\ncalibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local\ncalibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted\nprobabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon\ndistance.

To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property).

Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely\nadopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,\nhigh-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first\nvalidated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly\noutperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of\npredicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from\ntube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the\nstaged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,\npotentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.",

    "abstract": "Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.\nLegal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,\nlexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose\nsignificant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While\nrecent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate\nnoisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided\nextraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework\naddresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and\ndomain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and\nlegal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to\nquantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results\nshow that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node\nduplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured\nprompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in\nnoisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust\nLLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex\nlegal texts.",

We\nbenchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,\nMasked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized\nvia Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most\n512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection\nof OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise.

This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks.

    "abstract": "Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models\nvia latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world\nmodels. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent\naction model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant\ntraining and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple\nand appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with\na powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and\nprone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which\nfor the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving\nthe core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that\neffectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the\npre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model\nacts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,\nwhile the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the\nworld model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage\nmethods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,\nestablishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.",

Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems\nthat simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student\nthinking or learning needs.\n  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process\nto a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:\nautomated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and\nvisualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The\nmodel is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure\npedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.\n  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,\nthe system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor\ncomments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on\n1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters\nbased on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,\nallowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.\n  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive\nvisualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting\ntargeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.",

Its success is partly attributed\nto conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large\nfixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant\ninformation. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain\nadaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a\ncentral agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient\nanalysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in\nMARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the\ncontext length, we present an efficient input representation for the central\nagent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a\nFourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal\ntrends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient\nrepresentation of the MARL environment.

    "abstract": "The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on\ncomprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative\ndata subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while\nretaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a\nmodel-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective\nperformance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a\nitem-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection\nshould be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,\nrather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by\nover 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM\nLeaderboard, using just a 0.5\\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores\nwith a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach\nenables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity\ndegradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more\ninterpretable benchmarking.",

Yet, their accurate\nand efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,\ninitialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.\nWhile data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the\ncomplex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic\nforecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow\nMatching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful\nprobabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric\ncirculation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast\nskillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20\ndays in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is\ncomparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes\nfor a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging\nFM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that\nSSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,\ndistinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by\ninternal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally\nefficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and\nshowcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of\natmosphere-climate dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model\ntraining across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling\nprivacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.\nHowever, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally\ndifferent neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain\nscarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to\nsupport architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate\nvariants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),\nstill presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate\nfederations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,\nCNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical\nheterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each\nclient's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,\nundermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,\nhave non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,\ncurrent methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose\nUnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous\nlocal networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a\nshared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to\nparameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean\ndistances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy\nbalancing convergence and diversity.

    "abstract": "Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining\ncausal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed\ninterventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional\ndata. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We\nevaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating\ninterventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures\nconsistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also\nfacilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be\ncostly to identify.",

    "abstract": "Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation\nwireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision\nlocalization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution\ntechniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,\nwhile generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models\nthat lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a\nSymbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based\nAngle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained\nsymbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam\npattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER\nachieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and\ninterpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a\ncontrolled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of\nthe known $\\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5\ndegree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further\nreduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that\nlack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a\nreal-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.\nSABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with\nnear-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\\'er-Rao Lower\nBounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and\naccurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA\nestimation.",

However, storing and replaying\ndata is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical\nfor arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without\naccess to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to\nsynthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing\nsamples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)\ngenerating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between\nsynthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)\ninversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through\nthe full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as\nCLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),\ninspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides\nstrong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing\niterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via\nGaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between\nsynthetic and real features.

Graph-based approaches have become increasingly\nimportant for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and\nstatic structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and\ntemporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural\nNetworks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by\nincorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation,\nenabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data. However, current\nresearch on HGNN-based anomaly detection remains fragmented, with diverse\nmodeling strategies, limited comparative evaluation, and an absence of\nstandardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey\nof HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a\ntaxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze\nrepresentative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also\nreview commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting\ntheir strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges\nrelated to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for\nfuture research.

To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured\ndatasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\\ell_2$-max-margin\nclassifier, in contrast to the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch\nAdam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the\nlimiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\\beta_2 \\to 1$ and we characterize\nits convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.\nFinally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges\nto the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\\beta$\nclose enough to 1.

In many practical settings, however, user interactions are\nlimited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,\nreal-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.\nFor example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses\ndifferently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying\nsimilarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under\nscenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling\nthe imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are\nunderrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering\nof Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets\nfrom multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize\nutility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose\nOff-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on\noffline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that\nexplicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the\nsecond challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting\nwith active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited\nnumber of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster\nstructure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,\nA$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative\ndimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively\ncollected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones.

However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a\nblack-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the\ndiffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate\nsamples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG\nperforms weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according\nto the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling\nstrategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to\nour desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the\nmulti-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood\ninterpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional\nmulti-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective\nmolecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single\ngeneration pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline\noptimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.\nNotably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can\nbe integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.",

    "abstract": "Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE)\npractices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software\nsystems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science\nresearch to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of\nthree cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,\nincluding collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 \"Software Engineering\n2030\" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions\ninvolving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to\nsystematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and\nsoftware products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of\nGenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related\nresearch challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated\ninto a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a\nrigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author\nteams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation\nfor analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for\nframing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these\nfindings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.",

    "abstract": "Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to\nidentify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats\nemerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly\nresolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself\nfaithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the\nsecret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or\nthe adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be\nprivate, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the\ndilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),\nenabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third\nparties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of\n`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints\nare built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and\nsummation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,\ncovering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and\nfour ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of\ncircumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public\nverifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without\ncompromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in\npractice.",

    "abstract": "Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving\ntheir general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable\nartificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such\nsolutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical\nrequirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to\nthe existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential\nprocess where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \\emph{inductive\napproach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.\nThis is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end\nof the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original\ndataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This\nenables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing\nclassification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple\nexperiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using\nCNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).\nExperiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model\nwith a high computational cost reduction.

    "abstract": "Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) seeks to improve user\npreference modeling by transferring knowledge from multiple domains. Despite\nthe progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or\nitems to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in\nreal-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and\nmodel-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying\nmulti-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows\nthat naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several\ndomain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained\nsolely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first\nexperimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based\ncross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we\nintroduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and\ntarget domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging.\nWeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not\nintroduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory.\nFurthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the\nupper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments\non single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation\nscenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation\nand consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation\ntasks.",

Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to\nalign semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative\nelements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate\ncontributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured\nrepresentations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.",

    "abstract": "In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become\nwidely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,\napproaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to\njointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short\nstochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step\nconsistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump\ngeneration, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a\ntrajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a\ndenoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and\non a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step\nDDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing\nlatency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow\ninference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a\npractical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.",

    "abstract": "In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain\ndistribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment\nconditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.",

We evaluate\nour tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and\nobject detection.

To support\nsystematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,\nconfigurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and\nscenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models\nvehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:\nmaximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The\nbenchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and\nvirtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together\nwith a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform\nimportance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare\nrepresentative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches\nunder identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario\ncombination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal\nsystematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform\ncapability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct\npreferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These\nobservations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform\ncapability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and\nselection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across\ndiverse platforms and scenarios.",

Existing\napproaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical\nframeworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent\nmemory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long\nhorizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting\nthe need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,\nand robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel\nSpatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene\ngeometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared\nrepresentation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a\nbrain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global\nplanning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute\nactions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution\nenables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent\nstate synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex\ncoordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results\ndemonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous\nembodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and\nrobust multi-robot collaboration.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic\nmanipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with\nRL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at\nintermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but\noften underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose\nHi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection\nsampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS\nstabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during\nonline fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective\nto provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we\ndevelop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible\nonline human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for\nlearning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two\nembodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich\nmanipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL\nbaselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.\nNotably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by\nreliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better\nperformance.",

While this approach has\nadvantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break\ndown under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,\na novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence\nbetween visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep\nlearning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for\nevery pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm\nmatches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted\nprobabilities and reliabilities.

However,\nenabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such\nconditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a\nhumanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich\nenvironments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive\ntorso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like\nresponses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional\nchallenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning\narchitecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each\ncomponent shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its\nparameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially\noutperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot\nachieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body\nweight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing\nimprovements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the\nbest-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack\n(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N).

In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view\nvideos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),\nor high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we\ntriangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and\nuncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and\nqualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with\nchildren, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and\ndistress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises\ncomplex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds\nare broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative\nsurvey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is\nviewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and\ngovernment. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and\nparental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of\nwhether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters\npropose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while\nopponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.\nUltimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared\nresponsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by\ndetailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete\ndesign and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot\ndiscontinuation.",

    "abstract": "Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high\nresilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control\ndue to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a\nmorphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph\nneural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By\nrepresenting the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based\npolicy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable\nlearning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is\nvalidated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion\nprimitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It\nshows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations,\nand improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer\ndirectly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable\nreal-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of\nincorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity\nrobot control.",

Beyond\nrealistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual\nperception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still\nremains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging\nvisual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to\ncomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular\nVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including\nspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically\ncharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,\nwe curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables\nin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our\nfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning\npatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and\nlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal\nreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are\nnot yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging\nsigns as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\nProject page: https://video-cof.github.io",

    "abstract": "A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.\nGiven past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the\nembodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.",

If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns\nwhen to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety\nviolations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for\nmaking misaligned models safer after deployment.",

However, conventional methods, such as\nclosed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,\nseparate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and\nrequire dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting\nadaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these\nchallenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic\nincident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial\nperspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better\nlow-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep\nlearning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident\ndetection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected\ndataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity\nassessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a\nweb-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS\ndetected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local\ntransportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion\npropagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and\nenable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.\nCrucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on\nfrequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and\ncost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.\nThis study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated\nreal-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for\nthe operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation\nmanagement.",

We present \"Brain-IT\", a brain-inspired approach that\naddresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),\nallowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar\nbrain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as\nbuilding blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All\nmodel components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient\ntraining with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT\npredicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level\nsemantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic\ncontent of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to\ninitialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.\nBIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to\nlocalized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image\nreconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and\nsurpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective\nmetrics.

    "abstract": "Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due\nto their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their\nstrong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing\ntasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the\nlatent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in\noutputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have\nattempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based\napproaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal\nediting quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation\nframework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target\nvelocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct\ndirections, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final\nedited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and\nattribute disentanglement.

Prevailing\nmethods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is\nresource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen\neffects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video\ngeneration.

In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to\nunseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning\nstrategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context\nattention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential\neffect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect\nimitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient\none-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on\ntough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories\nof effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain\neffects.

    "abstract": "Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,\nand animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on\noptimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision\nor on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric\napproximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D\ngeneration of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with\nthe advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending\nthese methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models\nposes significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a\ntraining-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of\ntraining a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a\npre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape\nprior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by\ntreating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images\ncaptured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the\nobject's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring\ntask-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our\nmethod generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts\nunderlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object\ncategories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D\ncompletes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art\napproaches in both quality and versatility.",

    "abstract": "Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread\nattention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base\nmodels, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE\nachieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06.

To further improve segmentation quality, we\nintroduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating\nthe Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.\nResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a\nDice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise\nboundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911.

    "abstract": "Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has\nproven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for\nadapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter\nefficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where\nboth communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,\nglobal prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,\nwhile personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We\npropose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt\nTuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and\npersonalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we\nintroduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on\nclass-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each\ninput, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived\nfrom global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables\nper-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable\nparameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated\naveraging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,\nTinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT\nconsistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data\nheterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and\ngeneralizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.",

    "abstract": "Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal\nsequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined\ncategories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences\nwhile maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action\nRecognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D\nAction Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims\nto proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,\nhas been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample\nselection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to\nembed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,\ncombined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,\nis utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for\nannotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not\nnecessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may\nhave already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.\nTo solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active\nlearning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an\ninformative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of\nskeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of\nthe factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from\nEuclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning\nstrategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.\nExtensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is\nessential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer\ninteraction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight\ncoupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex\ninter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device\nmulti-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.\nInstead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire\ninference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,\nallowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also\nintroduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that\ncaptures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain\naccuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for\nfine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during\ninference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and\ninput data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration\noptimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for\neach modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping\nmechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early\npredictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public\nmultimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly\nreduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various\nsystem and data dynamics.",

In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing\na holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which\nquantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.\nUsing this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they\nconsistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural\nlocalization across all six languages studied.

Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability\nto produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step\nacross different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps\nunder the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards\nare used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with\ntrajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use.

Trainium, an AI\naccelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an\nattractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous\narchitecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance\ncan be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special\nrequirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix\nmultiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on\nTrainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on\nkernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the\nsoftware-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive\nmatrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show\nthat our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by\nAWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x\nspeedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to\n2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.",

Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still\noperate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic\nverification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a\nneurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of\nverifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on\nchallenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating\nsignificant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over\nbaselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but\nalso fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards\ntransparent, programmatic errors.

    "abstract": "The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large\nlanguage models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising\nconcerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model\nperformance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate\nthese assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse\nmultilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study\nchallenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find\nthat combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the\nin-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a\nsufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we\nobserve that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language\nthat serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits\nacross language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot\nlanguage from within a specific family does not consistently improve\nperformance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a\nsignificant \"curse of multilinguality\" as the number of training languages\nincreases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,\nwhen balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without\ncompromising performance, even in low-resource settings",

At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven\nloop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language\nmodel, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies\ndiscrepancies.

To support this shift, we introduce\ncollaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility\ngrows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated\nevaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in\nmulti-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent\ndesign: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.\nCollaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and\nguiding development toward more effective interactions.",

For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with\ncalendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect\nanomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing\nlanguage agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks\nthat lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to\nevaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the\nTool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering\ndiverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable\nexecution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604\ntools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to\nprofessional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools\nare based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we\nmay have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily\nensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we\nprovide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas\ncourses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark\nincludes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting\nwith multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is\nstrictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive\nevaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the\nbest-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate\nwith 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model\nDeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%.

This paper aims to bridge the gap,\nspecifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning\ninstruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M\nnon-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a\nthinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning\ndata at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced\nLLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage\ntraining paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and\nreinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and\ndiverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.\nLastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning\n42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR\nscenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including\nDeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and\nachieving a 10\\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT.

In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of\nthe available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference\nrequires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for\nassessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,\nintroducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as\ngenerated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic\nprogram. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids\nunnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word\nproblems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in\nsemantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked\naccuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent\ndistractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through\nirrelevant inferences.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural\nLanguage Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains\nlike religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination\nand unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly\ncritical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and\ntrustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nsystems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,\nmulti-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To\naddress this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful\nAdvanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built\nupon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative\nRefinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting\nprocess: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence\nsufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,\nprogressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base\nof over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates\nsuperior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA\nbenchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable\n97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a\nhigh Answer Correctness score of 74.3%.

To address this limitation, this paper\nstudies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of\ninformation asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and\nskills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein\nPuzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game.

We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier\nframework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication\nstrategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results\nhighlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when\nagents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.\nInterestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task\nperformance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule\nunderstanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an\nenvironment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules\nand complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration\nin AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in speech foundation models (SFMs) have enabled the direct\nprocessing of spoken language from raw audio, bypassing intermediate textual\nrepresentations. This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially\nrespond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal.\nOne under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality,\nencompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation\ntypes are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and\nsocial meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely\nrely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to\nfailure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic\nfeatures influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through\nopen-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether\nmodel behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce\na new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality,\ndesigned to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice.

    "abstract": "We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)\narchitecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized\nquantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden\nstate is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially\nlarge Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,\nmaking the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.\nAt each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding\nand processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical\nnonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state\nvia unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it\nunifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial\nobservation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control\nfor input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with\nup to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,\nand language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to\nobtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum\nmemory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit\nreadouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine\ntranslation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)\ngrounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against\nstrong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce\n\\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and\ndeploying proactive dialogue agents \\textit{directly from offline expert data},\nbypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to\nreframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \\textbf{observed\nfuture} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,\nturn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,\ndecomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised\nlearning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action,\nstate_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,\n\\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader\nCalibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward\nmodel with minimal human supervision.

Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and\ndemonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic\nequivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias\ntoward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to\ndetect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and\nLLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases.

By maintaining low levels of autonomy and\nselectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under\nsupervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving\ntransparency and reliability.",

Our evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean\nprojects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not\nreadily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model\nachieving only a 10.3 % pass rate.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language\nat the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI\nrequires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly\nimplicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared\ncontext) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines\nLLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and\nwhether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show\nthat larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while\nsmaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,\nimplicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and\nquality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.\nOverall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded\nprompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually\nnuanced communication.

    "abstract": "Industrial recommender systems rely on unique Item Identifiers (ItemIDs).\nHowever, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large,\ndynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail data. Content-based Semantic IDs\n(SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However,\nby ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have\nlimited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral\ninformation but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform\ncontent features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,\ncreating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and\nlong-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise\nCorruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative\nnoise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to\nthe loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The\nequal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of\ndifferent behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to\ndistinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we\npropose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,\nDenoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior\nmodalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this\nframework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive\nbehavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield\nrepresentations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical\nsignals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public\nand large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant\nsuperiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural\nLanguage Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains\nlike religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination\nand unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly\ncritical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and\ntrustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nsystems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,\nmulti-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To\naddress this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful\nAdvanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built\nupon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative\nRefinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting\nprocess: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence\nsufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,\nprogressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base\nof over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates\nsuperior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA\nbenchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable\n97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a\nhigh Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for\nPersian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is\ncrucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.",

It\ntypically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the\nquery and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and\nrelevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its\nvector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging\ntop-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed\nbased on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are\nrelevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed\nspecifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language\nmodels (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free\nquery reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again,\nrelies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting\nquality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed\nframework: \\textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which\nperforms model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents,\nnot only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the\nrelevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training\npipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy\nfeedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers\ndemonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing\nit as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.",

This\nis because convolutional filters alone, generally fixed filters, struggle to\ncapture global interactions necessary for accurate recommendation. We propose\nTime-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a\nmodel inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters\ncapture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing\nboth fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec\nachieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction\npatterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for\nself-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.\nExtensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.",

A key challenge lies in exploring\noptimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent\nresearch follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator\nproduces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In\npractice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.\nHowever, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the\nseparation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,\nautoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we\npropose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address\nthe two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an\nautoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic\nautoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we\npre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter\ninitialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating\nsequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we\npropose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient\nautoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),\nwhich trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items\nwhile preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time\nrecommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF\noutperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is\nnearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also\nbeen deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily\nactive users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.",

    "abstract": "AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external\nknowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not\ninherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that\nMDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP\nframework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.",

StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on\nmodule that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control\nstack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it\ninterfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,\ninterpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that\ncan be executed by the AV's native planner.

However, conventional methods, such as\nclosed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,\nseparate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and\nrequire dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting\nadaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these\nchallenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic\nincident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial\nperspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better\nlow-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep\nlearning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident\ndetection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected\ndataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity\nassessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a\nweb-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS\ndetected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local\ntransportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion\npropagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and\nenable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.\nCrucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on\nfrequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and\ncost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.\nThis study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated\nreal-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for\nthe operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation\nmanagement.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has\nbeen proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled\nas rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this\napproach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium\nattitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the\nattitude-error Euler axis larger than {\\pi}rad, their proportional-control\neffect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of\nthe CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude\ncontrol law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle\ninformation to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater\nflexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two\ndifferent control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict\nLyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique\nequilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly\nasymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and\nperformance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and\nexecuted dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.\nThese simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed\naxis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that\nobtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of\nstabilization time.",

This\nlimitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this\nchallenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile\nsensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved\nsurfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict\nlocal curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,\nachieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily\nobjects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that\nthe curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all\nsurfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature\nincreases.

We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in\nwhich large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical\ndebate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each\nround, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a\ncontrol agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A\npanel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in\nsimulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through\niterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing\nincreasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and\nspecialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a\nquadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther\nthan the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a\npowerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that\nmulti-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising\nnew paradigm for automated robot design.",

Experimental results over 15 trials\nfind that STITCH 2.0 on average achieves 74.4% wound closure with 4.87 sutures\nper trial, representing 66% more sutures in 38% less time compared to the\nprevious baseline. When two human interventions are allowed, STITCH 2.0\naverages six sutures with 100% wound closure rate. Project website:\nhttps://stitch-2.github.io/",

    "abstract": "The ability to use random objects as tools in a generalizable manner is a\nmissing piece in robots' intelligence today to boost their versatility and\nproblem-solving capabilities. State-of-the-art robotic tool usage methods\nfocused on procedurally generating or crowd-sourcing datasets of tools for a\ntask to learn how to grasp and manipulate them for that task. However, these\nmethods assume that only one object is provided and that it is possible, with\nthe correct grasp, to perform the task; they are not capable of identifying,\ngrasping, and using the best object for a task when many are available,\nespecially when the optimal tool is absent. In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a\ntwo-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by\nlearning first to extend the robot's embodiment in simulation and then\ntransferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key\ninsight is that by exploring a robot's embodiment extensions (i.e., building\nnew end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool\ngeometries most beneficial for a task. This learned geometric knowledge can\nthen be distilled to perform generalized tool usage tasks by selecting and\nusing the best available real-world object as tool. On a real robot with 22\ndegrees of freedom (DOFs), GeT-USE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by\n30-60% success rates across three vision-based bimanual mobile manipulation\ntool-usage tasks.",

Yet when these VLMs\nare adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their\noriginal VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,\nshowing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual\nrepresentations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's\nhidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of\ntargeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart\nVLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We\nfurther evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and\nintroduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields\nimproved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.

When a\ndomain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may\nultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in\nslower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement\nissues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches\nonly add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search\neffort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the\ncommon-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to\nidentify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix\nthese failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains\nshow that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and\ndomain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases,\neliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse\nrange of instances from the broader domain.",

Image-based\nquantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor\nspeed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus\nreaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than\nexhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus\nreaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of\npropagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding\nmedium in forming octopus-like reaching motion.

    "abstract": "Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by\nencoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing\ncomplex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining\nthe shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or\nBox formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.\nWhen more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a\nstatic shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose\na formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost\nfunction while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation\nplanner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative\nrobot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear\nand non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.\nWe theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do\nnot need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized\nusing relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are\nrealized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's\ndirect approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for\nmilitary-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,\nwe show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When\nminimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation\nplanner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning\nprovides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that\nclosely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape\nabstraction.",

    "abstract": "Robotic manipulation of deformable and fragile objects presents significant\nchallenges, as excessive stress can lead to irreversible damage to the object.\nWhile existing solutions rely on accurate object models or specialized sensors\nand grippers, this adds complexity and often lacks generalization. To address\nthis problem, we present a vision-based reinforcement learning approach that\nincorporates a stress-penalized reward to discourage damage to the object\nexplicitly. In addition, to bootstrap learning, we incorporate offline\ndemonstrations as well as a designed curriculum progressing from rigid proxies\nto deformables. We evaluate the proposed method in both simulated and\nreal-world scenarios, showing that the policy learned in simulation can be\ntransferred to the real world in a zero-shot manner, performing tasks such as\npicking up and pushing tofu. Our results show that the learned policies exhibit\na damage-aware, gentle manipulation behavior, demonstrating their effectiveness\nby decreasing the stress applied to fragile objects by 36.5% while achieving\nthe task goals, compared to vanilla RL policies.",

    "abstract": "Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:\nconventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire\ndepth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an\nill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with\nelements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication\ncomplexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,\nwe first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around\nwhich we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic\nco-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying\nPoint Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform\nelements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a\nsynthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This\nsimulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction\nnetwork that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity\nAll-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.\nExtensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed\nframework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an\nRMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and\nother deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM\nof 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior\nbalance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that\nthe integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint\nreconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the\nintrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging.

While transferring into\nhand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires\nnot only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along\nthe object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation\nframework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated\nobjects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a\ndiscrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along\nwith the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an\nHAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its\nlanguage description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is\nemployed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated\nobject joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand\nmanipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction\nand HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and\nexperimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation\nperformance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp\napplication that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning\nusing the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA.

Classical methods like Lucas-Kanade (LK) offer lightweight tracking\nbut are fragile to occlusion and drift, while deep learning-based approaches\noften require continuous visibility and intensive computation. To address these\ngaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced\nperception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher\nconstrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module\noperating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);\nthen, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by\ntexture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a\nthreshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from\nrecent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation,\nrotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz\nimage-based servo loops.

    "abstract": "Interpreting visual observations and natural language instructions for\ncomplex task execution remains a key challenge in robotics and AI. Despite\nrecent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly\nfor UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation\n(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to\ngeneralize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The\nemergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,\nenables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,\nthese models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to\nnavigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive\nUAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with\ngeometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image\nannotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A\nhybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM\nreasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant\nrevisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital\ntwin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental\nresults show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by\n25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%.

    "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic\nmanipulation by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), and action decoders\ninto a unified architecture. However, their deployment on resource-constrained\nedge devices, such as mobile robots or embedded systems (e.g., Jetson Orin\nNano), remains challenging due to high computational demands, especially in\nreal-world scenarios where power, latency, and computational resources are\ncritical. To close this gap, we introduce Nano-scale Vision-Language Action\n(NanoVLA), a family of lightweight VLA architectures that achieve high\nperformance with minimal resources. Our core innovations include: (1)\nvision-language decoupling that moves conventional early vision and language\ninputs fusion in VLM to late stage, achieving better performance while enabling\ncaching and reduce inference overhead and latency; (2) long-short action\nchunking to ensure smooth, coherent multi-step planning without sacrificing\nreal-time responsiveness; (3) dynamic routing that adaptively assigns\nlightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity, further optimizing\ninference efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as\nreal-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster\ninference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models,\nwith 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy\nand generalization. Ablation studies confirm that our decoupling strategy\npreserves cross-task transferability, and the routing module enhances\ncost-performance trade-offs, enabling practical, high-precision robotic\nmanipulation on resource-constrained hardware.",

The assignment-based method has played\nan eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot\nswarms.

This article presents a\ntutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot\nswarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component\nis the recently developed \\emph{mean-shift exploration} strategy, which\nimproves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times.\nFurther, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale\nincreases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the\nmean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area\ncoverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding\nindustrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo\ntransportation.",

    "abstract": "Accurate calibration of a Stewart platform is important for their precise and\nefficient operation. However, the calibration of these platforms using forward\nkinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally\ngenerates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving\nplatform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths\nconnecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the\ndifficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.\nThe authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using\nDenavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1\ndeveloped in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based\ncalibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational\nupon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used\ntheir calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted\nthree compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve\nthe accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution\ndigital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving\nplatform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any\nadditional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the\nhexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves\nmultiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position\nand orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The\nTarget poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations\nare estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses.\nResults from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable\nenhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further\nimprovements.",

    "abstract": "The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care\nrobots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on\nhandcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse\nscenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the\nhuman brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which\nunderlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory\nsignals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal\nrecurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the\nfree-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional\nvisuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was\nable to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and\nflexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We\ndemonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent\ndynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,\nand infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through\nvisuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in\nmultitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on\nrepositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest\nreduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.\nAlthough the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish\npredictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,\npointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while\noffering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible\nadaptation in uncertain real-world environments.",

To\naddress this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG\nthrough trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior\napproaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,\nR3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within\nthe RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the\nenvironment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the\nretriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks\ndemonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original\nretriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving\ncomparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on\npost-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,\nrequiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.",

    "abstract": "Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent\ntext but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus.\nExisting retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich\nprofiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and\noften yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a\nunified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization\nthrough iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM\ngenerator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic\nLLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on\ntone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then\nrevises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across\niterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as\nBest-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,\nGoodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization\nover PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5\nrefinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These\nresults highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful\nparadigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and\nmodel-agnostic.",

    "abstract": "The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has renewed interest in\nwhether recommender systems can achieve similar scaling benefits. Conventional\nrecommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as\nembedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm\nreplaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by\nautoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain\nproprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected\nscaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training\nrecipe that enables competitive performance?\n  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully\nopen-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end\nworkflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and\nrecommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual\nQuantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters\non the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward\ntrend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size,\nvalidating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further\nenhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training\npipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies\nreinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards.

Owing to the massive candidate pool and strict latency constraints,\nindustry systems often rely on lightweight two-tower architectures, which are\ncomputationally efficient yet limited in estimation capability. As a result,\nthey struggle to capture the complex synergistic and suppressive relationships\namong candidate items, which are essential for producing contextually coherent\nand diverse recommendation lists. Moreover, this simplicity further amplifies\nthe Sample Selection Bias (SSB) problem, as coarse-grained models trained on\nbiased exposure data must generalize to a much larger candidate space with\ndistinct distributions.\n  To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{DUET} (\\textbf{DU}al Model\nCo-Training for \\textbf{E}ntire Space C\\textbf{T}R Prediction), a set-wise\npre-ranking framework that achieves expressive modeling under tight\ncomputational budgets. Instead of scoring items independently, DUET performs\nset-level prediction over the entire candidate subset in a single forward pass,\nenabling information-aware interactions among candidates while amortizing the\ncomputational cost across the set. Moreover, a dual model co-training mechanism\nextends supervision to unexposed items via mutual pseudo-label refinement,\neffectively mitigating SSB. Validated through extensive offline experiments and\nonline A/B testing, DUET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nand achieves improvements across multiple core business metrics.

While many flavors of the TOP exist\nfor planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate\ntoward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the\nrobots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic\nPrize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the\npresence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy\nconstraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and\nstar graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs\nthat coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a\nrank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal\nRank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in\ntemporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious\nOrdinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's\nsenior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and\nsynthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show\nthat 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies\nthat scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the\nglobal index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced\nprize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods.\nFinally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95%\noptimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer\nlinear programming.",

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a\npromising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to\ncomplex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable\nnature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear\noptimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training\non sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited\nsequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging\nits warm-up period.\n  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient\nslope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in\ndeeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,\nwe find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much\nmore pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead\nto a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we\npropose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to\nbootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment\ninteractions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive\nslope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an\naverage return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,\nincluding Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points\nunder the same conditions.

However, its lack of environmental\ninformation poses significant challenges for obstacle avoidance. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm, Cooperative\nNon-inertial frame-based Obstacle Avoidance (CoNi-OA), designed explicitly for\nUAV-UGV cooperative scenarios without reliance on global state estimation or\nobstacle prediction. CoNi-OA uniquely utilizes a single frame of raw LiDAR data\nfrom the UAV to generate a modulation matrix, which directly adjusts the\nquadrotor's velocity to achieve obstacle avoidance. This modulation-based\nmethod enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the\nUGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less\nthan 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable\nenvironments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a\nmodulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV\ncooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time\ntrajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the\nneed for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static\nand dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or\nunknown scenarios.",

While recent\napproaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised\nrepresentation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms\nsuch as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or\nscene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize\n2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and\ndynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present\nDynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and\ndynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future\nprediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on\nmulti-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future\ndynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned\nrepresentations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic\nmanipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two\nchallenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic\nexperiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate,\ngeneralization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability\nacross diverse manipulation tasks.",

One of the key challenges in achieving this goal is to enable these\nsystems to manipulate objects and tools in a manner that is similar to that of\nhumans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning human-style\nmanipulation skills by using adversarial motion priors, which we name HMAMP.\nThe approach leverages adversarial networks to model the complex dynamics of\ntool and object manipulation, as well as the aim of the manipulation task. The\ndiscriminator is trained using a combination of real-world data and simulation\ndata executed by the agent, which is designed to train a policy that generates\nrealistic motion trajectories that match the statistical properties of human\nmotion. We evaluated HMAMP on one challenging manipulation task: hammering, and\nthe results indicate that HMAMP is capable of learning human-style manipulation\nskills that outperform current baseline methods. Additionally, we demonstrate\nthat HMAMP has potential for real-world applications by performing real robot\narm hammering tasks. In general, HMAMP represents a significant step towards\ndeveloping robots and autonomous systems that can interact with humans in a\nmore natural and intuitive way, by learning to manipulate tools and objects in\na manner similar to how humans do.",

Recently, it has gained\nprominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where\nachieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of\ntasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates\na (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the\ntask's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is\ncompelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that\ncloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its\nfully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg\ninsertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from\nthe Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical\nanalysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with\n$\\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to\nthe demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and\npractice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with\nfewer demonstrated tasks.

However,\nsignificant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical\nspaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level\nactions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large\nlanguage models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor\ngeneralization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate\nseamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across\nembodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \\textbf{Boundless Large\nModel (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves\ninstruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and\nsupports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key\ncapabilities -- \\textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and\ncross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I\ninjects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while\nmaintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an\nintent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to\nguide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported\nby a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot\nembodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital\nand physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four\nmodel families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving\n$\\sim\\!\\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\\sim\\!\\textbf{3%}$ in physical\ntasks.",

On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is\ntypically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and\nmaps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We\nintroduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory\nScoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs\nwithout losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of\nour knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only\nlearning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data.\nZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive\nPolicy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable\nactions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three\nbenchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop\nplanning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM\n(simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the\nstate-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on\nHUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.",

Among\nthese, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to\nidentify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting\nprecise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting\nexample-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images\n(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of\ncapturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To\novercome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that\nunifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide\nembeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a\ncorpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained\nmorphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and\nflexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)\nmosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide\nresearch; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly\nretrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public\npathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including\nanatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,\nand grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and\nstomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional\nimage-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further\ndemonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,\nand enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical\nscenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable\nretrieval solution for digital pathology.",

    "abstract": "The core task of recommender systems is to learn user preferences from\nhistorical user-item interactions. With the rapid development of large language\nmodels (LLMs), recent research has explored leveraging the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs to enhance rating prediction tasks. However, existing\ndistillation-based methods suffer from limitations such as the teacher model's\ninsufficient recommendation capability, costly and static supervision, and\nsuperficial transfer of reasoning ability. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes RecZero, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based recommendation paradigm\nthat abandons the traditional multi-model and multi-stage distillation\napproach. Instead, RecZero trains a single LLM through pure RL to autonomously\ndevelop reasoning capabilities for rating prediction. RecZero consists of two\nkey components: (1) \"Think-before-Recommendation\" prompt construction, which\nemploys a structured reasoning template to guide the model in step-wise\nanalysis of user interests, item features, and user-item compatibility; and (2)\nrule-based reward modeling, which adopts group relative policy optimization\n(GRPO) to compute rewards for reasoning trajectories and optimize the LLM.\nAdditionally, the paper explores a hybrid paradigm, RecOne, which combines\nsupervised fine-tuning with RL, initializing the model with cold-start\nreasoning samples and further optimizing it with RL. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that RecZero and RecOne significantly outperform existing baseline\nmethods on multiple benchmark datasets, validating the superiority of the RL\nparadigm in achieving autonomous reasoning-enhanced recommender systems.",

    "abstract": "Financial documents are essential sources of information for regulators,\nauditors, and financial institutions, particularly for assessing the wealth and\ncompliance of Small and Medium-sized Businesses. However, SMB documents are\noften difficult to parse. They are rarely born digital and instead are\ndistributed as scanned images that are none machine readable. The scans\nthemselves are low in resolution, affected by skew or rotation, and often\ncontain noisy backgrounds. These documents also tend to be heterogeneous,\nmixing narratives, tables, figures, and multilingual content within the same\nreport. Such characteristics pose major challenges for automated information\nextraction, especially when relying on end to end large Vision Language Models,\nwhich are computationally expensive, sensitive to noise, and slow when applied\nto files with hundreds of pages.\n  We propose a multistage pipeline that leverages traditional image processing\nmodels and OCR extraction, together with compact VLMs for structured field\nextraction of large-scale financial documents. Our approach begins with image\npre-processing, including segmentation, orientation detection, and size\nnormalization. Multilingual OCR is then applied to recover page-level text.\nUpon analyzing the text information, pages are retrieved for coherent sections.\nFinally, compact VLMs are operated within these narrowed-down scopes to extract\nstructured financial indicators.\n  Our approach is evaluated using an internal corpus of multi-lingual, scanned\nfinancial documents. The results demonstrate that compact VLMs, together with a\nmultistage pipeline, achieves 8.8 times higher field level accuracy relative to\ndirectly feeding the whole document into large VLMs, only at 0.7 percent of the\nGPU cost and 92.6 percent less end-to-end service latency.",

By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space,\nthey deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However,\ntheir ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,\nespecially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained\nquery-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet effective unified framework E2Rank, means Efficient Embedding-based\nRanking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single text embedding\nmodel to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise reranking through\ncontinued training under a listwise ranking objective, thereby achieving strong\neffectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying cosine similarity between\nthe query and document embeddings as a unified ranking function, the listwise\nranking prompt, which is constructed from the original query and its candidate\ndocuments, serves as an enhanced query enriched with signals from the top-K\ndocuments, akin to pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval\nmodels. This design preserves the efficiency and representational quality of\nthe base embedding model while significantly improving its reranking\nperformance. Empirically, E2Rank achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR\nreranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the\nreasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also\nshow that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the\nMTEB benchmark.

    "abstract": "In Taobao e-commerce visual search, user behavior analysis reveals a large\nproportion of no-click requests, suggesting diverse and implicit user intents.\nThese intents are expressed in various forms and are difficult to mine and\ndiscover, thereby leading to the limited adaptability and lag in platform\nstrategies. This greatly restricts users' ability to express diverse intents\nand hinders the scalability of the visual search system. This mismatch between\nuser implicit intent expression and system response defines the User-SearchSys\nIntent Discrepancy. To alleviate the issue, we propose a novel framework\nREVISION. This framework integrates offline reasoning mining with online\ndecision-making and execution, enabling adaptive strategies to solve implicit\nuser demands. In the offline stage, we construct a periodic pipeline to mine\ndiscrepancies from historical no-click requests. Leveraging large models, we\nanalyze implicit intent factors and infer optimal suggestions by jointly\nreasoning over query and product metadata. These inferred suggestions serve as\nactionable insights for refining platform strategies. In the online stage,\nREVISION-R1-3B, trained on the curated offline data, performs holistic analysis\nover query images and associated historical products to generate optimization\nplans and adaptively schedule strategies across the search pipeline. Our\nframework offers a streamlined paradigm for integrating large models with\ntraditional search systems, enabling end-to-end intelligent optimization across\ninformation aggregation and user interaction. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our approach improves the efficiency of implicit intent mining from\nlarge-scale search logs and significantly reduces the no-click rate.",

    "abstract": "Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search\napplications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space,\nthey deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However,\ntheir ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,\nespecially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained\nquery-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet effective unified framework $\\text{E}^2\\text{Rank}$, means Efficient\nEmbedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single\ntext embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise\nreranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective,\nthereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying\ncosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified\nranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the\noriginal query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query\nenriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance\nfeedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the\nefficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while\nsignificantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically,\n$\\textrm{E}^2\\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR\nreranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the\nreasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also\nshow that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the\nMTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can\neffectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational\nefficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.",

Our agent starts by building a \"cognitive map\" by performing a\nlightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner\nproposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in\ncognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and\nupdate the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On\nthe WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%\nsuccess rate for the previously published state-of-the-art.

However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval\nstrategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of\nretrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when\nto retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved\ninformation effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a\nquery-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality\nselection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response\nquality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction\nTuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize\nretrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we\nadopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert\nquestion-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets.

    "abstract": "Users tend to remember failures of a search session more than its many\nsuccesses. This observation has led to work on search robustness, where systems\nare penalized if they perform very poorly on some queries. However, this\nprinciple of robustness has been overlooked within a single query. An ambiguous\nor underspecified query (e.g., ``jaguar'') can have several user intents, where\npopular intents often dominate the ranking, leaving users with minority intents\nunsatisfied. Although the diversification literature has long recognized this\nissue, existing metrics only model the average relevance across intents and\nprovide no robustness guarantees. More surprisingly, we show theoretically and\nempirically that many well-known diversification algorithms are no more robust\nthan a naive, non-diversified algorithm. To address this critical gap, we\npropose to frame diversification as a risk-minimization problem. We introduce\nVRisk, which measures the expected risk faced by the least-served fraction of\nintents in a query. Optimizing VRisk produces a robust ranking, reducing the\nlikelihood of poor user experiences. We then propose VRisker, a fast greedy\nre-ranker with provable approximation guarantees. Finally, experiments on NTCIR\nINTENT-2, TREC Web 2012, and MovieLens show the vulnerability of existing\nmethods. VRisker reduces worst-case intent failures by up to 33% with a minimal\n2% drop in average performance.",

We design a\nscalable document expansion pipeline that leverages both open- and\nclosed-source LLMs to generate, validate, and refine enriched tool profiles at\nlow cost, producing large-scale corpora with 50k instances for embedding-based\nretrievers and 200k for rerankers.

Extensive experiments on ToolRet and Tool-DE\ndemonstrate that document expansion substantially improves retrieval\nperformance, with Tool-Embed and Tool-Rank achieving new state-of-the-art\nresults on both benchmarks.

However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)\nconstruction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of\nreal-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent\nzero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance\non prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as\nwell as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that\nbuilds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from\nunstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained\n\"atomic\" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it\nconstructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling\nthat distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The\nresulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%\nbetter stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,\ndemonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.",
